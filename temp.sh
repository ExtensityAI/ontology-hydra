uv run demo2.py --input temp/fiction/data/* --domain "The domain covers all internal aspects of fiction books, providing a comprehensive view of their structure and content. It includes basic bibliographic information—such as title, subtitle, author, co-authors, editors, illustrators, translators, publisher, publication date, edition, series information, ISBN, and language. All individuals involved in the creation and production of the book are included, allowing for a detailed record of contributors and their roles.    Central to the domain are the characters who appear in the story. This encompasses main characters, supporting characters, and minor or background figures. For each character, details such as names, aliases, physical descriptions, personality traits, internal motivations, backstory, beliefs, values, character arcs, and psychological profiles are considered. The domain also incorporates the dynamic relationships between characters—family bonds, friendships, rivalries, romantic involvements, mentorships, alliances, and antagonisms—and how these relationships change and develop over the course of the narrative.    The plot is another major focus, encompassing the sequence of events, both major and minor, that drive the story forward. This includes the structure of the plot (such as exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution), as well as significant turning points, subplots, conflicts, resolutions, and character participation in each event. The domain provides for tracking how the narrative unfolds over time and which characters or groups are involved in specific plot elements.    Settings are included in detail, ranging from large-scale locations like countries, cities, and fictional worlds to smaller, more specific places such as buildings, rooms, or landscapes. Time periods and chronology, including historical eras, fantasy timelines, or future settings, are part of the domain, providing context for when and where the story takes place.    Themes and motifs are addressed, covering overarching ideas, philosophical questions, recurring images or symbols, and moral or social issues explored in the book. Symbolic elements and recurring motifs that support thematic development are also included.    The narrative approach forms part of the domain, accounting for the point of view (first-person, third-person, omniscient, etc.), voice, tone, and mood of the storytelling. It can also include stylistic choices and literary devices used by the author, such as flashbacks, foreshadowing, unreliable narration, or non-linear storytelling.    The domain is strictly limited to the internal makeup of fiction books. It does not include non-fiction content, external marketing data, sales figures, critical reviews, adaptations (such as films or TV series), reader demographics, or any information about derivative or fan-created works. The focus remains entirely on the fictional work’s structure, content, and narrative elements." --output temp/fiction/output
