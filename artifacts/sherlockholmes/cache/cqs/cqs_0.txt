What are the precise definitions and key attributes of character roles such as protagonist, antagonist, supporting characters, and narrators in the ontology?
How does the ontology distinguish between different types of character motivations and psychological traits across diverse cultural backgrounds?
What classification scheme is used to categorize characters based on identity aspects including multicultural, sociopolitical, and global literary variety?
How are character development arcs formally represented, and what properties capture growth or transformation over the narrative?
What specific relationships between characters are modeled, and how are they semantically differentiated (e.g., familial, antagonistic, alliances)?
How does the ontology represent significant narrative events, including their classifications by plot importance, causal relationships, and temporal sequencing?
What domain constraints are applied for representing event chronology and causal linkages within complex story arcs?
How are physical and temporal settings modeled, including environmental elements and sociopolitical, cultural, and historical influences on the narrative mood and tone?
What properties and classifications support detailed world-building, especially for fantastical or speculative settings?
In what ways does the ontology support multiple types of story arcs (linear, non-linear, multi-layered), and how are narrative progression stages like exposition, climax, and resolution represented?
How are thematic, emotional progression, and narrative pacing encoded within the story arc constructs?
What narrative context metadata schemas (e.g., MARC, Dublin Core) are integrated, and how do they support multilingual representation, localization, and archival preservation?
Which cultural, socio-political, historical, and postcolonial factors are represented as context properties influencing characters, events, and settings?
How does the ontology differentiate between fictional adaptations of history and actual historical records within event and setting representations?
What domain-specific rules govern the exclusion of author information, reader interpretations, multimedia adaptations, and technical linguistic details?
How are gray areas such as the intersection of narrative theory, cultural studies, and computational modeling addressed in the ontology structure?
How are internal character psychological states and motivations modeled while acknowledging overlaps with cognitive sciences?
What classifications or properties capture diversity and inclusivity in cultural and identity representation across characters and settings?
How does the ontology model complex, interwoven story arcs, including hybrid and interactive narrative formats within the constraints of fiction book narratives?
What mechanisms exist in the ontology to accommodate semantic annotations that preserve the historical and cultural context integrity of fiction narratives?
How does the ontology structure accommodate scalability and extensibility for future integration with digital humanities and AI-driven storytelling tools?
