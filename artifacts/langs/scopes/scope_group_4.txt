## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Fundamental Concepts
- **Syntax:** The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in a programming language.
- **Semantics:** The meaning of the statements and expressions in a programming language, distinguishing between valid syntax and what the code actually does.
- **Data Type:** A classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold, such as integers, strings, or booleans.
- **Control Flow:** The order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed in a program.
- **Function:** A block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task, often encapsulated with parameters and a return value.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.

### 2.2 Programming Paradigms
- **Imperative Programming:** A programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state.
- **Declarative Programming:** A paradigm that expresses the logic of computation without explicitly detailing the control flow.
- **Event-Driven Programming:** A programming paradigm in which the program flow is determined by events such as user actions or sensor outputs.

### 2.3 Development Tools
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development.
- **Version Control (e.g., Git):** A system that records changes to files or sets of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.

### 2.4 Testing and Debugging
- **Unit Testing:** A software testing method by which individual pieces of code (units) are tested for correctness.
- **Debugging:** The process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software.

### 2.5 Real-world Applications
- **Web Development:** The work involved in developing a website for the internet or an intranet.
- **Mobile Development:** The act of developing software applications for mobile devices.
- **Data Science:** An interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. 

This scope document serves as a guideline for discussions and initiatives related to the fundamentals of different programming languages, recognizing both the breadth of inclusion and the limitations inherent in specifying this domain.
