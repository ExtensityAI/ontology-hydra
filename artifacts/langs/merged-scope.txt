## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Fundamental Concepts
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols considered correctly structured in a programming language.
- **Semantics**: The meaning of statements and expressions in a programming language, distinguishing between valid syntax and the code's actual function.
- **Data Type**: A classification indicating the kind of value a variable can hold (e.g., integer, float, string).
- **Control Flow**: The order in which statements, instructions, or function calls are executed in a program.
- **Function/Procedure**: A block of reusable code designed for a specific task, with potential parameters and return values.
  
### 2.2 Programming Paradigms
- **Imperative Programming**: A style of programming that uses statements to change a program's state.
- **Declarative Programming**: A paradigm that expresses the logic of computation without detailing control flow.
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Programming that is organized around events or actions, typically user-driven.
- **Functional Programming**: A programming style that emphasizes the evaluation of functions and avoids mutable state.

### 2.3 Development Tools
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: A comprehensive facility for software development, providing a code editor, debugger, and automation tools.
- **Version Control System (e.g., Git)**: A system tracking changes to files over time, enabling version recovery.

### 2.4 Testing and Debugging
- **Unit Testing**: A method of software testing aimed at verifying individual units for correctness.
- **Debugging**: The process of identifying and fixing bugs in code or hardware.

### 2.5 Real-world Applications
- **Web Development**: Creating applications and websites for online use.
- **Mobile Development**: Developing software applications for mobile devices.
- **Data Science**: Utilizing algorithms and models to analyze data for insights.

### 2.6 Accessibility Terms
