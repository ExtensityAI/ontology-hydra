# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included in the Domain
- **Core Language Features**
  - Syntax and semantics
  - Data types (e.g., strings, lists, dictionaries, sets)
  - Control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals)
  - Functions and modules
  - Object-oriented programming concepts (e.g., classes, inheritance)
  - Exception handling
  - Decorators and context managers

- **Language Philosophy**
  - Python's design philosophy, including readability and simplicity
  - The Zen of Python (PEP 20)

- **Standard Library**
  - Core libraries that are part of the Python distribution (e.g., `math`, `datetime`, `sys`)

### 1.2 Explicitly Excluded from the Domain
- **External Libraries and Frameworks**
  - Third-party libraries such as Pandas, Flask, or NumPy
  - Ecosystem packages that extend or enhance Python itself

- **Development Practices**
  - Software engineering methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall)
  - Development tools (e.g., IDEs, version control systems)

- **Domain-Specific Applications**
  - Fields such as web development, data science, machine learning, or automation that utilize Python for specific purposes

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps with Adjacent Domains
- **Python's Ecosystem**
  - Libraries/functions that may cross between core language and third-party packages
  - Interactions between Python and other languages or platforms (e.g., C extensions, Jython)

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Language Features
- **Variable**: A name that refers to a value stored in memory.
- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can return a value.
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data and behavior.
- **Module**: A file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables.

### 2.2 Data Structures
- **List**: An ordered, mutable collection of items.
- **Tuple**: An ordered, immutable collection of items.
- **Dictionary**: A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique.
- **Set**: An unordered collection of unique items.

### 2.3 Control Structures
- **Loop**: A control structure that repeats a block of code while a condition is true.
- **Conditional Statement**: A statement that performs different actions based on whether a condition is true or false.

### 2.4 Object-Oriented Concepts
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism for a new class to receive properties and behaviors from an existing class.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to treat objects of different classes in a uniform way.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Software Developers**: Individuals who write and maintain Python code.
- **Technical Authors**: Writers who create documentation and educational content around Python.
- **Educators**: Professionals who teach Python in academic or boot camp settings.

### 3.2 Perspectives
- **Beginner Programmers**: Individuals new to programming looking for foundational knowledge.
- **Experienced Developers**: Practiced programmers seeking deeper understanding or advanced features of Python.
- **Technical Writers**: Professionals focused on creating clear, comprehensive documentation for Python users.
