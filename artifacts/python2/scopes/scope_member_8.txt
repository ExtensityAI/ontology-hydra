## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Topics
- Syntax and Semantics
  - Basic syntax rules
  - Data types and structures
  - Control flow
  - Functions and modules
- Object-Oriented Programming
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
- Error Handling and Exceptions
- Standard Libraries
  - Built-in functions and modules
  - Commonly used libraries like `math`, `datetime`, etc.
- Concurrency and Parallelism
  - Threading
  - Multiprocessing
  - Asynchronous programming
- Pythonic Principles
  - Readability and simplicity
  - The Zen of Python

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- Python Ecosystem
  - Frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask)
  - Libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)
  - Development tools and environments (e.g., IDEs, package managers)
- Deployment and Production
  - Cloud services integration
  - Containerization and microservices
- Community and Governance
  - Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)
  - Community practices and conventions

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps
- Interaction with Other Languages
  - Python’s interoperability with languages like C or Java
- The Role of Python in Data Science
  - While Python is a critical tool in data science, the broader data science ecosystem is not included in this scope.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Programming Concepts
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs.
- **Data Types**: Categories of data that determine the kind of operations that can be performed on them (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
- **Control Flow**: The order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed in a program.

### 2.2 Object-Oriented Concepts
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects; defines a set of attributes and methods.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where one class can derive attributes and methods from another class.

### 2.3 Error Handling
- **Exception**: An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
- **Try-Except Block**: A construct that allows handling exceptions gracefully.

### 2.4 Pythonic Concepts
- **Readability**: Python’s philosophy of writing clear and understandable code.
- **The Zen of Python**: A collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in Python (accessible via `import this`).

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- Software Developers
- Technical Leads
- Software Architects
- Educators and Trainers
- Open Source Contributors

### 3.2 Different Viewpoints
