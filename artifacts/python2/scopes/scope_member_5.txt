# Scope Document for The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Inclusion in the Domain
- The core language constructs of Python, including:
  - Syntax
  - Data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
  - Control structures (if statements, loops)
  - Functions and modules
  - Object-oriented programming features (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
  - Exception handling
  - File I/O

### 1.2 Exclusions from the Domain
- Ecosystem-related components, such as:
  - External libraries and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, NumPy)
  - Package management tools (e.g., pip, conda)
  - Deployment methods and environments (e.g., Docker, cloud platforms)
  - Specific application domains (e.g., web development, data science)

### 1.3 Gray Areas and Overlaps
- Integration with other languages or technologies (e.g., C extensions)
- Interpretation of Python through different implementations (e.g., CPython, PyPy)
- The distinction between Python language features and the behavior of standard libraries

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Basic Constructs
- **Variable**: A named storage location for data.
- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

### 2.2 Data Types
- **Primitive Types**: Basic data types like integers, floats, and strings.
- **Collection Types**: Data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

### 2.3 Control Flow
- **Conditional Statements**: Structures for branching logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
- **Loops**: Constructs for repeated execution (`for`, `while`).

### 2.4 Advanced Features
- **Decorator**: A function that modifies the behavior of another function.
- **Generator**: A special type of iterable that generates values on-the-fly using the `yield` statement.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Technical Writers**: Responsible for creating documentation and tutorials.
- **Educators**: Focus on teaching programming concepts in beginner-friendly formats.
- **Software Developers**: Users who apply Python in various contexts, influencing language usage and best practices.

### 3.2 Different Viewpoints
- **Beginners vs. Experienced Programmers**: Different levels of understanding and requirements for documentation.
- **Academic vs. Practical Implementations**: Distinction between learning for theory versus application.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics

### 4.1 Key Areas for Exploration
- Common challenges faced by beginners when learning Python.
- Best practices for writing clear, effective code and documentation.
- Understanding how Pythonâ€™s syntax and features facilitate learning programming concepts.

### 4.2 Topics Needing Clarification
- The importance of indentation and whitespace in Python.
- Differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and implications for learners.
- The role of typing (dynamic vs. static typing) in programming with Python.
