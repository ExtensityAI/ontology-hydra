# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries
### 1.1 Included Topics
- **Core Language Features**: Syntax, semantics, and grammatical structure of Python.
- **Data Types and Structures**: Built-in types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements, loops, exception handling.
- **Functions and Modules**: Definition, scope, arguments, return values, and module creation.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Standard Library**: Essential modules and packages included with Python.
- **Memory Management**: Object lifecycle, garbage collection, and reference counting.
- **Model Implementation**: Interpreter, bytecode execution, and Virtual Machine.
- **Performance Optimization**: Profiling, benchmarking, and code efficiency considerations.

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- **Python Ecosystem**: Frameworks (like Django, Flask), libraries, third-party integrations (like NumPy, Pandas).
- **Deployment Tools**: Cloud deployment platforms and services related to Python (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google App Engine).
- **Development Environments**: IDEs, editors, and debugging tools specific to Python.
- **User Interface Elements**: Python graphic user interface (GUI) libraries and frameworks.

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps
- **C Extensions for Python**: While they enhance performance, the focus on C implementations may blur boundaries between core language and extensions.
- **Python Packaging and Distribution**: Relevant to core scoping as it affects how Python is utilized but less about core development.
- **Technical Discussions**: May include aspects related to cloud deployment but should focus on Python core discussions.

## 2. Core Terminology
### 2.1 Language Features
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered correct.
- **Semantics**: The meaning behind syntactic elements; how computations are performed.

### 2.2 Data Structures
- **Mutable vs Immutable**: Types that can and cannot change after creation.
- **Slicing**: Extraction of subsets from sequences like lists or strings.

### 2.3 Control Flow
- **Looping Constructs**: `for`, `while`, iteration techniques.
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, logical operators.

### 2.4 Object-Oriented Concepts
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Method**: A function defined in a class that operates on its instances.

### 2.5 Performance Terminology
- **Benchmarking**: Measuring the performance of code or algorithms.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management, reclaiming memory occupied by objects no longer in use.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives
### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Core Developers**: Contributors who add features or fix bugs in the Python language itself.
- **Language Users**: Developers and programmers who use Python to build applications.
- **Educators**: Teachers and trainers who specialize in teaching the Python language.

### 3.2 Different Perspectives
- **Performance-Oriented Viewpoints**: Focus on optimizations and efficiency of core language features.
- **Usability Viewpoints**: Considerations of how language features impact developer experience and learning.
- **Compatibility Viewpoints**: Ensuring backward compatibility of existing code with new language versions.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics
### 4.1 Key Areas for Exploration
- **Core Language Design Decisions**: How specific features were decided and their implications.
- **Improvements in Recent Versions**: Changes made in the last few releases, rationale, and impact.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Strategies and techniques being implemented for future versions.

### 4.2 Topics Needing Clarification
- **Implementation of New Features**: Challenges and discussions surrounding adding new core functionalities.
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Approach taken to maintain and evolve the language over different versions.

This scope document aims to provide a foundational understanding of the core Python programming language, establishing clear boundaries and terminology essential for future discussions among stakeholders in the domain.
