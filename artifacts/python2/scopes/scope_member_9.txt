   - Ecosystem tools (e.g., pip, virtual environments)
   - Python implementation details (e.g., CPython, PyPy)
   - Advanced topics (e.g., concurrency, parallelism)

1.3 **Gray Areas or Overlaps**
   - Discussions about the Python ecosystem may surface when addressing the extensibility and capabilities of the core language.
   - Benefits of Python compared to other programming languages could lead to points regarding libraries and applications, which are beyond core Python.

## 2. Core Terminology

2.1 **Core Language Fundamentals**
   - **Syntax**: The set of rules that define the combinations of symbols and structures in the language.
   - **Data Types**: Categories of data that determine what operations can be performed (e.g., integer, float, string, list, dictionary).
   - **Control Structures**: Constructs that dictate the flow of execution (e.g., if statements, loops).
   
2.2 **Functions and Modules**
   - **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
   - **Module**: A file containing Python definitions and statements that can be imported to organize code logically.
   
2.3 **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data and functionality.
   - **Object**: An instance of a class containing data and methods defined by the class.

2.4 **Error Handling**
   - **Exception**: An error that occurs during the execution of a program which disrupts the normal flow.
   - **Debugging**: The process of identifying and removing errors from code.

2.5 **Input/Output**
   - **File Handling**: Operations for reading from and writing to files.
   - **Standard Input/Output**: Basic operations for receiving input and displaying output in the terminal.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

3.1 **Key Roles and Stakeholders**
   - **Developers**: Individuals creating applications using Python without leveraging external libraries.
   - **Educators**: Instructors teaching Python fundamentals and best practices.
