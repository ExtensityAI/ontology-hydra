## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Basic Syntax and Concepts
- **Variable**: A storage location with a name, representing a value.
- **Control Structure**: A statement that governs the flow of control.
- **Function**: A block of code organized to perform a specific task.

### 2.2 Data Handling
- **Data Structure**: A method of organizing data for efficient access and modification.
- **Comprehension**: A concise way to create collections or generate sequences.

### 2.3 Object-Oriented Programming
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data and behavior.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism for a new class to receive properties from an existing class.

### 2.4 Error Handling
- **Exception**: An event that disrupts the normal flow of execution.

### 2.5 File Handling
- **Context Manager**: A construct that ensures proper acquisition and release of resources.
