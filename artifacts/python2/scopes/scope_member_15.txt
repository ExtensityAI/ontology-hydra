  - Object lifecycle
  - References and mutability

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- **Ecosystem Considerations**
  - Third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask)
  - Development environments and tools (e.g., IDEs, linters)

- **Interoperability with Other Languages**
  - Bridges and integration (e.g., Python with C or Java)

- **Application Domains**
  - Specific use cases (e.g., web development, data science)

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps with Adjacent Domains
- **Cross-language Features**
  - Comparison with other programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Ruby)
- **Software Engineering Principles**
  - Concepts that overlap with general software development practices (e.g., design patterns)

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Basic Terminology
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines combinations of symbols in Python.
- **Semantics**: The meaning behind the syntactic elements of Python code.

### 2.2 Programming Constructs
- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Lambda**: An anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword.
- **Decorator**: A function that modifies the behavior of another function.

### 2.3 Data Handling
- **Immutable**: An object whose state cannot be modified after it is created (e.g., tuples, strings).
- **Mutable**: An object that can be modified after it is created (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

### 2.4 Error Management
- **Exception**: An error that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
- **Try-Except block**: A construct for handling exceptions in Python.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Educators**: Individuals teaching Python, focusing on its use in programming curricula.
- **Researchers**: Academics studying programming languages and their paradigms.
- **Developers**: Practitioners writing Python code in various contexts.

### 3.2 Viewpoints
- **Pedagogical Perspective**: How Python constructions are taught for effective learning.
- **Theoretical Perspective**: Language theory and its applications in Python design.
- **Practical Perspective**: Real-world use cases and programming challenges in Python.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics

### 4.1 Key Areas for Exploration
- **Teaching Approaches**: Effective methods for introducing Python syntax and semantics.
- **Language Evolution**: Changes in Python over time and their impact on users.
- **Error Handling Strategies**: Best practices for managing exceptions in Python applications.

### 4.2 Clarification Topics
- **Object-Oriented vs. Functional Paradigms**: Understanding the implementation of these paradigms within Python.
- **Memory Management**: Insights into how Python manages memory allocation and collection.

This scope document aims to set a clear foundation for discussions related to the Python programming language, focusing on its pure form while recognizing the boundaries of the domain and the relevant terminology.
