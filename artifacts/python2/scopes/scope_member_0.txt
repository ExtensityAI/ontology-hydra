# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Topics
- **Syntax and Semantics:**
  - Python syntax rules
  - Variable declaration and scope
  - Control structures (if, for, while)
  - Functions and methods
  - Exception handling

- **Data Types:**
  - Primitive types (int, float, bool, str)
  - Compound data types (list, tuple, set, dict)
  - User-defined data types (classes, objects)

- **Built-in Functions and Libraries:**
  - Standard library components
  - Commonly used functions (map, filter, reduce)
  - Data manipulation techniques

- **Pythonic Constructs:**
  - List comprehensions
  - Generators
  - Decorators
  - Context managers

- **Object-Oriented Programming:**
  - Class and instantiation
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Encapsulation

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- **Ecosystem Tools and Libraries:**
  - External libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Django, etc.)
  - Development tools and IDEs (PyCharm, VSCode)

- **Deployment and Integration:**
  - Environment management (virtualenv, pipenv)
  - Integration with other languages or systems (C, Java)

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Profiling tools
  - Compilation techniques (Cython, PyPy)

### 1.3 Gray Areas
- **Version Differences:**
  - Differences between Python 2.x and 3.x
  - Compatibility considerations for legacy code

- **Advanced Concepts:**
  - Metaclasses and advanced OOP principles can straddle boundaries between core language and ecosystem

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Syntax and Semantics
- **Syntax:** The set of rules that defines combinations of symbols in the programming language.
- **Semantics:** The meaning associated with syntactical elements.

### 2.2 Data Types
- **Primitive Type:** Basic data types provided by Python (raw values).
- **Compound Type:** Data types that can hold multiple values (collections).
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating user-defined data types (objects).

### 2.3 Pythonic Constructs
- **List Comprehension:** A concise way to create lists using a single line of code.
- **Generator:** A special type of iterator that yields values one at a time.

### 2.4 Object-Oriented Concepts 
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling of data and methods that operate on that data.
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism for creating new classes from existing ones.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Developers:** Users who write Python code, ranging from novices to experts.
- **Educators:** Individuals teaching Python in academic or bootcamp settings.
- **Researchers:** Scholars exploring programming language theory related to Python.

### 3.2 Viewpoints
- **Industry Perspective:** Focus on practical application and performance in workplace settings.
- **Academic Perspective:** Emphasis on language design, theory, and pedagogy.
- **Community Perspective:** Insights from open-source contributors and maintainers of Python libraries.
