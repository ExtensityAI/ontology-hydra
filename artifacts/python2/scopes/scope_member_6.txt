# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Inclusion
- The Python programming language itself
  - Syntax and semantics
  - Built-in data types and structures
  - Control flow statements (loops, conditionals)
  - Functions and modules
  - Exception handling
  - Object-oriented programming concepts
  - Functional programming features

### 1.2 Exclusion
- Python libraries and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask)
- Ecosystem tools (e.g., package managers, IDEs)
- Project management practices in Python (e.g., deployment strategies)
- Language comparisons (e.g., with Java, JavaScript)

### 1.3 Gray Areas
- Hybrid programming paradigms (e.g., using Cython or Jython)
- Interfacing Python with other languages
- Embedded Python or behavior within other systems 

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Basic Constructs
- **Variable**: Named storage location for data.
- **Data type**: Classification of data (e.g., integers, strings).
- **Function**: A defined block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

### 2.2 Object-Oriented Concepts
- **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data and behavior.
- **Object**: Instance of a class.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism for creating a new class based on an existing class.

### 2.3 Control Structures
- **Loop**: Control structure for repeating a block of code (e.g., `for`, `while`).
- **Conditional**: Control statements that execute different blocks of code (e.g., `if`, `elif`, `else`).

### 2.4 Advanced Features
- **Decorator**: A function that modifies the behavior of another function.
- **Generator**: A function that returns an iterator and maintains its state.

### 2.5 Domain-Specific Terms
- **PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)**: A design document providing information to the Python community, describing new features or implementations.
- **Namespace**: An environment that holds a collection of identifiers (variable names) and ensures uniqueness.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Developers**: Individuals who write Python code for various applications.
- **Educators**: Professionals teaching Python in academic or training settings.
- **Researchers**: Users applying Python for scientific computing or data analysis.

### 3.2 Perspectives
- **Novices**: Beginners learning Python and its syntax.
- **Intermediate Developers**: Those with foundational knowledge looking to deepen their understanding.
- **Advanced Practitioners**: Experienced developers focused on best practices and optimization techniques.
