## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Basic Programming Concepts
- **Syntax**: Set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured.
- **Variable**: A symbolic name associated with a value and whose associated value may be changed.
- **Function**: A reusable block of code designed to perform a single, related action.

### 2.2 Object-Oriented Programming
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data for the object.
- **Object**: An instance of a class containing state and behavior.
- **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class derives properties from an existing class.

### 2.3 Error Handling Mechanisms
- **Exception**: An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program during execution.
- **Try-Except Block**: A construct for handling exceptions in Python.

### 2.4 Versioning and Compatibility
- **Python 2.x/3.x**: Refers to different major versions of Python with distinct features and compatibility considerations.
