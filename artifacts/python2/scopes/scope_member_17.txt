# Scope Document for The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Topics 
- **Core Syntax and Structure**
  - Variables
  - Data Types (e.g., strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
  - Control Flow (e.g., if statements, loops)
  - Functions (defining, calling, arguments, return values)

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism

- **Error Handling and Exceptions**
  - Try/Except Blocks
  - Custom Exception Classes 

- **Built-in Functions and Modules**
  - Common built-in functions (e.g., len(), type(), str())
  - Standard library overview (e.g., datetime, math, random)

- **Comprehensions and Generators**
  - List Comprehensions
  - Dictionary Comprehensions
  - Generator Functions and Expressions

### 1.2 Explicitly Excluded Topics 
- **Third-party Libraries and Frameworks**
  - Excluded frameworks such as Django, Flask, etc.
  
- **Python Ecosystem**
  - Tools and environments such as Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks
  
- **Advanced Topics**
  - Implementation details (e.g., CPython internals)
  - Performance optimization techniques (e.g., profiling and optimization)

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps
- **Data Science and Machine Learning**
  - While relevant concepts may utilize Python, they fall outside the core language focus.
  
- **Web Development**
  - Basic web-related syntax is included, but frameworks and libraries are excluded.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Syntax and Structure
- **Variable**: A storage location identified by a name that contains a value.
- **Function**: A block of code designed to perform a specific task, defined with def.
- **Module**: A file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables.

### 2.2 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that defines properties and methods.
- **Inheritance**: The mechanism by which one class inherits attributes and methods from another class.

### 2.3 Error Handling
- **Exception**: An error detected during execution.
- **Try/Except Block**: A construct that allows the programmer to handle errors flexibly.

### 2.4 Comprehensions
- **List Comprehension**: A concise way to create lists using a single line of code.
- **Generator**: A special type of iterable that generates values on the fly.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Educators**: Those who teach Python at various educational levels.
- **Students**: Learners who are engaging with Python both in formal education and self-study.
- **Software Developers**: Practitioners who may need to use Python for development purposes.
  
### 3.2 Different Viewpoints
- **Beginner Perspective**: Focus on understanding basic concepts and syntax.
- **Professional Developer Perspective**: Emphasis on best practices, efficiency, and code readability.
- **Academic Perspective**: Interest in theoretical aspects and principles of computer science as related to Python.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics
