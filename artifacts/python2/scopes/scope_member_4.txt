# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries
### 1.1 Included in the Domain
- Fundamental concepts of Python programming:
  - Syntax and semantics
  - Data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
  - Control structures (if statements, loops, functions)
  - Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
  - Exception handling
  - File I/O (reading and writing files)
  - Standard libraries (e.g., `math`, `datetime`, `os`, `sys`)

### 1.2 Explicitly Excluded
- Third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django)
- Python package management (e.g., pip, virtual environments)
- Advanced topics like concurrency, asynchronous programming, or metaprogramming
- Python's ecosystem or development tools (e.g., IDEs, editors)
- Deployment and production environment considerations

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps
- Basic concepts of data science or machine learning using Python are excluded but could touch upon Python libraries such as NumPy or Pandas.
- Basic integration with database systems, which encapsulates the use of Python for data manipulation but does not cover specific database technologies.

## 2. Core Terminology
### 2.1 Fundamental Concepts
- **Syntax:** The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs.
- **Data Type:** A classification that specifies which kind of value a variable can hold.
- **Function:** A reusable piece of code that performs a specific task.

### 2.2 Control Structures
- **Conditional Statement:** A statement that executes different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.
- **Loop:** A structure that repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### 2.3 Object-Oriented Terminology
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects containing data and methods.
- **Object:** An instance of a class that holds its own attributes and can call methods defined in the class.

### 2.4 Error Handling
- **Exception:** An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
- **Try/Except Block:** A code construct for handling exceptions.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives
### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Educators:** Instructors teaching Python programming in academic institutions or bootcamps.
- **Students:** Learners from diverse backgrounds engaging with Python to develop programming skills.

### 3.2 Perspectives
- **Beginner Perspective:** Emphasizes foundational understanding and overcoming initial fears of coding.
- **Experienced Perspective:** Focuses on advanced features, best practices, and code optimization.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics
### 4.1 Core Topics for Exploration
- Common challenges faced by beginners learning Python
- Effective teaching methods and resources for Python educators
- The impact of hands-on projects on learning retention

### 4.2 Areas Needing Clarification
- Understanding the balance between theory and practice in teaching Python
- The role of peer coding reviews in enhancing collaborative learning
- Current trends in Python related to emerging technologies, such as AI and data visualization methods

This document serves as a foundational guideline for understanding the scope of the Python programming language, ensuring clarity and focus for future discussions and educational initiatives.
