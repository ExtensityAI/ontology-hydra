# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Topics
- **Syntax and Semantics**
  - Language basics: variables, data types, operators, control structures
  - Function definitions and scopes
  - Exception handling and error management
  
- **Data Structures**
  - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
  - String manipulation and operations
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
  - Magic methods and class properties
  
- **Functional Programming Features**
  - First-class functions
  - Higher-order functions
  - List comprehensions and generator expressions

- **Modules and Packages**
  - Standard library and its components
  - Module creation and import mechanisms
  
- **Built-in Functions and Methods**
  - Commonly used functions (e.g., map, filter, reduce)
  - String and collection methods
  
- **Type Hinting and Annotations**
  - Static typing concepts and syntax
  - Benefits of type hints for readability and maintenance

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- **Python Ecosystem**
  - Third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask)
  - Package management (e.g., pip, conda)

- **Deployment and Production Environments**
  - Application deployment strategies
  - Containerization and server management
  
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Compiling, JIT compilation, and CPython vs alternate implementations
  
- **Interfacing with Other Languages**
  - Using Cython or C extensions, and calling C/C++ libraries
  
- **Web Development**
  - HTTP frameworks, REST APIs, and web application architecture

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps
- **Code Libraries and Utilities**: While pure Python syntax will be discussed, specific library implementations (e.g., NumPy for arrays) are regarded as external ecosystems.
  
- **Python Programming Paradigms**: Discussions involving paradigms (e.g., functional vs. object-oriented) may overlap but will maintain focus on the core syntax and language features themselves.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Syntax and Language Constructs
- **Statement**: A single line of code that performs an action.
- **Expression**: A piece of code that evaluates to a value.
  
### 2.2 Data Types
- **Primitive Types**: int, float, str, bool
- **Composite Types**: list, tuple, set, dict

### 2.3 Object-Oriented Terminology
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances).
- **Instance**: A specific object created from a class.
- **Method**: A function defined within a class.

### 2.4 Functional Programming
- **Lambda**: An anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword.
- **Closure**: A function that captures the environment in which it was created.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Software Developers**: Individuals who write and maintain Python code.
- **Educators**: Teachers and trainers emphasizing Python in educational settings.
- **Technical Writers**: Contributors to documentation and learning materials.

### 3.2 Different Viewpoints
- **Beginner vs. Advanced Users**: The approach to learning and using Python varies greatly.
- **Industry-specific Applications**: Different sectors (e.g., data science, web development) may have unique requirements.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics

### 4.1 Key Areas to Explore
