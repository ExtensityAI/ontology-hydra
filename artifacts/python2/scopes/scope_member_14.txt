# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language 

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Inclusion Criteria
- The scope includes:
  - The core syntax and structure of the Python language
  - Fundamental programming concepts (variables, data types, control structures, functions, modules)
  - Object-oriented programming principles as applied in Python
  - Standard libraries and built-in functions provided by Python
  - Performance considerations (e.g., memory management, execution speed)

### 1.2 Exclusion Criteria
- The scope explicitly excludes:
  - Third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask)
  - Data science and machine learning techniques specifically implemented in Python
  - Ecosystem components (e.g., package management, virtual environments)
  - Python implementation versions (e.g., CPython, PyPy)

### 1.3 Gray Areas
- Discussions surrounding Python in the context of web development may arise; however, the focus should remain strictly on language features rather than applications.
- Consideration of Python's role in various domains (data science, web development, etc.) is relevant but must be delineated from Python as a programming language itself.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 General Programming Concepts
- **Syntax**: The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols in a programming language.
- **Variables**: Named storage locations in memory that hold data.
- **Data Types**: Classification of data into categories (e.g., integers, strings, lists, dictionaries).
- **Control Structures**: Constructs that dictate the flow of execution (e.g., loops, conditionals).

### 2.2 Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects that encapsulate data and behaviors.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes that hold data and can perform methods associated with their class.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism for creating a new class from an existing class, inheriting attributes and behaviors.

### 2.3 Language Features
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task.
- **Modules**: Files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables.

### 2.4 Core Libraries
- **Standard Library**: A collection of modules and packages included with Python that provide standardized solutions for common tasks.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles 
- **Developers**: Individuals who write and maintain Python code.
- **Educators**: Teachers and trainers who instruct others in Python programming.
- **Researchers**: Scholars employing Python for algorithmic implementations or research in computational fields.

### 3.2 Viewpoints
- **Expert Users**: Experienced developers who approach Python from an advanced technical perspective.
- **Novice Programmers**: Beginners who may focus on basic syntax and functionality, seeking accessible learning resources.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics

### 4.1 Areas for Exploration
- Evolution of Python syntax from earlier versions to current.
- Practical challenges faced by new users learning Python's syntax.
- The impact of Python's object-oriented design on programming practices.
  
### 4.2 Clarification and Deeper Exploration
- Differences between Pythonâ€™s core data types and how they are used in programming.
- Understanding memory management in Python and its implications for performance.
- Exploration of the design philosophy guiding Python's development and community standards. 

This scope document serves as a foundation for discussions around the Python programming language, establishing clear definitions and boundaries to facilitate better communication and understanding among stakeholders and researchers in the field.
