# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Topics
- **Syntax and Semantics**: Examination of Python's grammar, structure, and operational meaning.
- **Data Types**: Exploration of built-in types (int, float, str, list, tuple, set, dict) and user-defined types.
- **Control Structures**: Investigation of conditionals (if, elif, else), loops (for, while), and comprehension constructs.
- **Functions and Scoping**: Definition and usage of functions, including first-class functions, lambda functions, and scoping rules.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Critical examination of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in Python.
- **Error Handling**: Discussion of exceptions, try-except blocks, and best practices for error management.
- **Modules and Packages**: Analysis of modular design, import mechanisms, and Python's namespace management.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Understanding threading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming.
- **Performance Characteristics**: Evaluation of Python's performance implications, including time complexity and optimization techniques.
- **Portability and Compatibility**: Consideration of Pythonâ€™s cross-platform capabilities and version differences.

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- **Python Ecosystem**: Libraries, frameworks, and third-party modules are not included in this scope.
- **Development Tools**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), version control, and deployment strategies are beyond this domain.
- **Specific Applications**: Use cases in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, etc., are not discussed.

### 1.3 Gray Areas
- **Interfacing with Other Languages**: Topics related to interacting with C, C++, or Java through Python, which blur the boundary between Python and other programming languages.
- **Metaprogramming**: While aspects of this are covered under classes and functions, its broader implications may overlap with frameworks and libraries.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Syntax and Language Structure
- **Syntax**: The set of rules defining the combinations of symbols that are considered correctly structured programs.
- **Semantics**: The meaning behind the syntax; what the program does when executed.

### 2.2 Data Representation
- **Primitive Types**: Basic data types such as integers and strings.
- **Composite Types**: Data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### 2.3 Programming Constructs
- **Function**: A block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task.
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects containing properties and methods.

### 2.4 Error Management
- **Exception**: An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution.

### 2.5 Performance Terms
- **Time Complexity**: A computational concept that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the size of the input.

### 2.6 Concurrency Concepts
- **Threading**: A method of achieving concurrency by running multiple threads within a single process.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: A programming paradigm that allows for tasks to be executed independently of the main program flow.
