## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Syntax and Data Types
- **Syntax:** The set of rules that defines the structure of Python code.
- **Data Type:** A classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold (e.g., integer, string).
  
### 2.2 Control Structures
- **Control Flow Statement:** Statements that determine the order in which code executes based on conditions.
- **Loop:** A sequence of instructions that repeats until a specific condition is met.

### 2.3 Object-Oriented Concepts
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects that encapsulates data and behavior.
- **Object:** An instance of a class that represents an entity.

### 2.4 Error Management
- **Exception:** An error that occurs during the execution of a program.
- **Throwing/Catching Exceptions:** Mechanism to handle errors gracefully without crashing the program.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Educators:** Those teaching Python programming in various educational contexts.
- **New Developers:** Beginners learning Python for the first time.
- **Experienced Developers:** Advanced users looking to deepen their understanding of core principles.

### 3.2 Relevant Viewpoints
