# Scope Document: The Python Programming Language

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Topics
- **Language Syntax and Semantics**
  - Grammar rules and structure of the Python language.
  - Data types, variables, and control flow.
  
- **Standard Libraries**
  - Built-in modules and packages that are part of the Python language core.
  - Specific functions and classes within the libraries.

- **Python Runtime Environment**
  - Execution model and mechanisms of the Python interpreter.
  - Memory management, garbage collection, and performance optimization.

- **Development Tools**
  - Core tools specific to the Python language (e.g., Python interpreter itself, IDLE).
  - Command-line interface and debugging tools.

- **Language Evolution**
  - Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and their role in language development.
  - Historical context of language changes, versioning, and deprecations.

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- **Python Ecosystem**
  - Third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, NumPy).
  - Tools and packages not included in the standard library.

- **Application Development Practices**
  - Software design patterns and methodologies outside the core language.

- **Interfacing with Other Languages**
  - Tools and libraries used for interoperability (e.g., Cython, SWIG).

### 1.3 Gray Areas and Overlaps
- **Specification vs. Implementation**
  - Distinction between theoretical specifications and practical implementations in the reference implementation (CPython).

- **Development Tools vs. Language Core**
  - Debate on whether development tools directly associated with the interpreter should be included in the scope.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Language Concepts
- **Syntax**: Rules that define the structure of valid Python code.
- **Semantics**: Meaning behind syntactical constructs in the Python language.

### 2.2 Data Types
- **Primitive Types**: Basic data types such as integers, floats, strings.
- **Composite Types**: Advanced data types including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

### 2.3 Control Flow Structures
- **Conditional Statements**: Control structures (if, elif, else) that determine execution based on conditions.
- **Loops**: Iteration mechanisms (for, while) that allow code to run multiple times.

### 2.4 Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)
- **PEP**: A design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python.

### 2.5 Python Interpreter
- **CPython**: The reference and most widely used implementation of Python.
- **Bytecode**: Intermediate code generated by the Python interpreter from source code.

## 3. Stakeholders and Perspectives

### 3.1 Key Roles
- **Core Developers**: Individuals contributing directly to improvements, maintenance, and evolution of the Python language.
- **Language Designers**: Contributors focusing on defining syntax, semantics, and overall language architecture.
- **Educators and Trainers**: Professionals developing educational content and training programs related to learning Python.

### 3.2 Different Viewpoints
- **Core vs. Ecosystem**: Core developers often prioritize language changes over ecosystem considerations.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Stakeholders might have differing views on how changes affect older versions of Python.

## 4. Potential Interview Topics

### 4.1 Key Areas to Explore
- **Key Language Features**: Discussions on features that affect syntax and semantics.
- **Evolutionary Changes**: Insight into how and why certain changes were made in the language.
- **Challenges in Development**: Understanding obstacles faced in maintaining and developing the Python core.

### 4.2 Topics Needing Clarification
- **Impact of PEPs on Language Design**: How proposals are evaluated and their implementation process.
- **Balance Between Innovation and Stability**: How the Python community addresses changes while maintaining a stable language.

This document serves as a framework to guide discussions and further investigations into the core aspects of the Python programming language.
