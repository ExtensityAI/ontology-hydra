1. Domain Definition and Scope
1.1 Purpose and Overview
- The ontology addresses the structured and comprehensive representation of individuals' life histories, encompassing personal information, educational and career trajectories, significant life events, relationships, and affiliations.
- All elements are contextualized with temporal (time-based) and spatial (location-based) attributes to support a multi-dimensional, chronological, and geospatial overview of a person's life journey.
- The framework supports data integration from diverse sources—including analog, digital, qualitative narratives, and multimedia—and accommodates various cultural, historical, and socio-economic contexts.
