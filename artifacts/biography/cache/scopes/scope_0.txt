3. Terminology
   3.1 Domain-Specific Terms and Concepts
       - "Life History": Comprehensive, structured record of an individual's personal, educational, professional, and relational trajectories over time and space.
       - "Personal Identifier": Unique attributes that distinguish an individual (name, date of birth, ID number).
       - "Event": Discrete, temporally and/or spatially anchored occurrence in an individual's life (e.g., birth, migration, graduation).
       - "Trajectory": Sequence or path of roles, affiliations, or locations over a period.
       - "Affiliation": Formal or informal connection to a group, organization, or community.
       - "Relationship": Connection between two or more persons, defined by type (familial, social, professional).
       - "Temporal Attribute": Information specifying timing or duration of an event or state.
       - "Spatial Attribute": Information specifying place or geographic context.
       - "Narrative": Qualitative, story-like account of an individual's experiences.
       - "Annotation": Supplementary note providing context, clarification, or interpretation.
       - "Provenance": Documentation of the origin or source of a record or data point.
       - "Consent Record": Documented permission for data collection, use, or sharing.
   3.2 Hierarchical Relationships Between Concepts
       - "Life History" comprises multiple "Events," each with "Temporal Attributes" and "Spatial Attributes."
       - Each "Event" may be associated with one or more "Relationships," "Affiliations," and "Annotations."
       - "Personal Information" provides core identifying context foundational to all other topics.
       - "Educational Trajectory" and "Career History" represent specific subtypes of "Event Sequences" and contribute to the overall "Life History."
       - "Narratives" and "Annotations" serve as overlays that contextualize and enrich the structured data elements of the life history.
       - "Affiliations" can be tied to either specific "Events" or represent ongoing statuses.
       - "Provenance" and "Consent Records" apply to any data element, ensuring traceability and ethical compliance.
