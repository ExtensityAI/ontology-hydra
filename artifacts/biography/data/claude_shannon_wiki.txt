'''Claude Elwood Shannon''' (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American [[mathematician]], [[electrical engineer]], [[computer scientist]], [[cryptographer]] and inventor known as the "father of [[information theory]]" and the man who laid the foundations of the [[Information Age]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal |last=Atmar |first=Wirt |date=2001 |title=A Profoundly Repeated Pattern |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=208–211 |jstor=20168572 |issn=0012-9623}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite magazine |last=Tse |first=David |author-link=David Tse |date=December 22, 2020 |title=How Claude Shannon Invented the Future |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-claude-shannons-information-theory-invented-the-future-20201222/ |access-date=September 28, 2023 |magazine=Quanta}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite magazine |last=Roberts |first=Siobhan |author-link=Siobhan Roberts |date=April 30, 2016 |title=The Forgotten Father of the Information Age |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/claude-shannon-the-father-of-the-information-age-turns-1100100 |magazine=The New Yorker |issn=0028-792X |access-date=September 28, 2023}}</ref> Shannon was the first to describe the use of [[Boolean algebra]]—essential to all [[digital electronic]] circuits—and helped found [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).<ref name=":10">{{Cite book |last=Slater |first=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWTtMyYmKhUC&pg=PA37 |title=Portraits in Silicon |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-262-69131-4 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |pages=37–38}}</ref><ref name="bmfrs">{{Cite journal |last1=James |first1=Ioan |author-link=Ioan James |doi=10.1098/rsbm.2009.0015 |title=Claude Elwood Shannon, 30 April 1916 – 24 February 2001 |journal=[[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] |volume=55 |pages=257–265 |year=2009}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite magazine |last=Horgan |first=John |author-link=John Horgan (journalist) |date=April 27, 2016 |title=Claude Shannon: Tinkerer, Prankster, and Father of Information Theory |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/claude-shannon-tinkerer-prankster-and-father-of-information-theory |access-date=September 28, 2023 |magazine=IEEE Spectrum}}</ref> Roboticist [[Rodney Brooks]] declared Shannon the 20th century engineer who contributed the most to 21st century technologies,<ref name=":4" /> and mathematician [[Solomon W.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
The Shannon family lived in [[Gaylord, Michigan]], and Claude was born in a hospital that was nearby [[Petoskey, Michigan|Petoskey]].<ref name="bmfrs"/> His father, Claude Sr. (1862–1934), was a businessman and, for a while, a judge of [[probate]] in [[Gaylord, Michigan|Gaylord]]. His mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon (1880–1945), was a language teacher, who also served as the principal of [[Gaylord High School]].{{sfnp|Sloane|Wyner|1993|p=xi}} Claude Sr. was a descendant of [[Colonial history of New Jersey|New Jersey settlers]], while Mabel was a child of German immigrants.<ref name="bmfrs"/> Shannon's family was active in their Methodist Church during his youth.<ref name="Soni Goodman 2017 p. 6">{{cite book | last1=Soni | first1=J. | last2=Goodman | first2=R. | title=A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age | publisher=Simon & Schuster | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-4767-6668-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gygsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 | access-date=2023-05-02 | page=6}}</ref>

Most of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home, he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire [[telegraph]] system to a friend's house a half-mile away.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-claude-shannon-b-1916-bit-player.html|title=THE LIVES THEY LIVED: CLAUDE SHANNON, B. 1916; Bit Player|first=James|last=Gleick|date=December 30, 2001|journal=The New York Times Magazine|page=Section 6, Page 48|author-link=James Gleick}}</ref> While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the [[Western Union]] company.

Shannon's childhood hero was [[Thomas Edison]], who he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of [[John Ogden (colonist)|John Ogden]] (1609–1682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.<ref name="MIT obituary">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/shannon.html|title=MIT Professor Claude Shannon dies; was founder of digital communications|website=MIT News office|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=February 27, 2001}}</ref><ref name="sloane-wyner93">{{cite book| title=Claude Elwood Shannon: Collected Papers | editor1-first=N.J.A | editor1-last=Sloane | editor2-first=Aaron D. | editor2-last=Wyner | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]/[[IEEE Press]] | isbn=978-0-7803-0434-5 | date=1993 | url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0780304349.html | access-date=December 9, 2016 }}</ref>

===Logic circuits===
In 1932, Shannon entered the [[University of Michigan]], where he was introduced to the work of [[George Boole]]. He graduated in 1936 with two [[bachelor's degree]]s: one in [[electrical engineering]] and the other in mathematics.

In 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he worked on [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyzer]], which was an early [[analog computer]] that was composed of electromechanical parts and could solve [[differential equation]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Claude_E._Shannon |title=Claude E. Shannon, an oral history |first=Robert|last=Price |work=IEEE Global History Network |year=1982 |publisher=IEEE |access-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> While studying the complicated ''ad hoc'' circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed [[switching circuit]]s based on [[Boolean algebra|Boole's concepts]]. In 1937, he wrote his [[master's degree]] thesis, ''[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]],''<ref name="SymbolicAnalysis">{{ cite journal

}}</ref> with a paper from this thesis published in 1938.<ref name="SymbolicAnalysis"/> A revolutionary work for [[switching circuit theory]], Shannon diagramed switching circuits that could implement the essential operators of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]. Then he proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the [[electromechanical]] [[relay]]s that were used during that time in [[public switched telephone network|telephone call routing switches]]. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a digital 4-bit full adder.<ref name="SymbolicAnalysis" /> His work differed significantly from the work of previous engineers such as [[Akira Nakashima]], who still relied on the existent circuit theory of the time and took a grounded approach.<ref name=":03">{{Cite journal |last=Kawanishi |first=Toma |date=2019 |title=Prehistory of Switching Theory in Japan: Akira Nakashima and His Relay-circuit Theory |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/historiascientiarum/29/1/29_136/_article |journal=Historia Scientiarum |series=Second Series |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=136–162 |doi=10.34336/historiascientiarum.29.1_136}}</ref> Shannon's idea were more abstract and relied on mathematics, thereby breaking new ground with his work, with his approach dominating modern-day electrical engineering.<ref name=":03" />

Using electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all [[Computer|electronic digital computers]]. Shannon's work became the foundation of [[digital circuit]] design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after [[World War II]]. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the ''ad hoc'' methods that had prevailed previously. [[Howard Gardner]] hailed Shannon's thesis "possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master's thesis of the century."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mind's New Science: A History of the Cognitive Revolution |first=Howard |last=Gardner |author-link=Howard Gardner |publisher=Basic Books |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-465-04635-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mindsnewscience00howa/page/144 144] |url=https://archive.org/details/mindsnewscience00howa/page/144 }}</ref> [[Herman Goldstine]] described it as "surely ... one of the most important master's theses ever written ...

Shannon received his PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940.<ref name="MIT obituary"/> Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], in order to develop a mathematical formulation for [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called ''An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics''.<ref>{{cite thesis|hdl=1721.1/11174|title=An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics|year=1940|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|type=Thesis|last1=Shannon|first1=Claude Elwood}} — Contains a biography on pp. 64–65.</ref> However, the thesis went unpublished after Shannon lost interest, but it did contain important results.<ref name=":11" /> Notably, he was one of the first to apply an algebraic framework to study theoretical population genetics.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Chalub |first1=Fabio A.

In 1940, Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and [[mathematician]]s such as [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[John von Neumann]], and he also had occasional encounters with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.<ref>{{cite thesis|hdl=1721.1/39429|title=The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory|year=2003|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|type=Thesis|last1=Guizzo|first1=Erico Marui}}</ref>

Shannon had worked at [[Bell Labs]] for a few months in the summer of 1937,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gertner |first=Jon |title=The idea factory: Bell Labs and the great age of American innovation |date=2013 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-312279-1 |location=London |pages=118}}</ref> and returned there to work on [[fire-control system]]s and [[cryptography]] during [[World War II]], under a contract with section D-2 (Control Systems section) of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC).

Shannon is credited with the invention of [[signal-flow graph]]s, in 1942. He discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer.<ref>{{Cite book|title = NASAP-70 User's and Programmer's manual|last1 = Okrent|first1 = Howard|publisher = School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California at Los Angeles|year = 1970|location = Los Angeles, California|pages = 3–9|first2 = Lawrence P.|last2 = McNamee|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19710025849|chapter-url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710025849.pdf|chapter = 3. 3 Flowgraph Theory|access-date = March 4, 2016}}</ref>

For two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British mathematician [[Alan Turing]]. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the [[U.S. Navy]]'s cryptanalytic service the methods used by the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] to break the cyphers used by the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' [[U-boat]]s in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=Hodges1992>{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges | year = 1992 | title = Alan Turing: The Enigma | location = London | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] | pages = 243–252 | isbn = 978-0-09-911641-7}}</ref> He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria.<ref name=Hodges1992 /> Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the "[[universal Turing machine]]".<ref>{{Citation | last= Turing | first= A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | year = 1936 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 42 | pages = 230–65 | doi= 10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230 | s2cid= 73712 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Turing | first = A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 43 | pages = 544–6 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544 | year = 1938 | issue = 6 }}</ref> This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own.

Shannon and his team developed anti-aircraft systems that tracked enemy missiles and planes, while also determining the paths for intercepting missiles.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58ySAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA183 |title=Computing: A Historical and Technical Perspective |date=2014 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4822-2741-3 |editor-last=Igarashi |editor-first=Yoshihide |edition= |location=Boca Raton, Florida |pages=183}}</ref>

In 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by Shannon, [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], and [[Hendrik Wade Bode]], formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with "the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems."<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0801880572|pages=319–320|title=Between Human and Machine: Feedback, Control, and Computing Before Cybernetics|last1=Mindell|first1=David A.|date=October 15, 2004|publisher=JHU Press }}</ref> In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[Information Age]].

Shannon's work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on [[communication theory]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=David |author-link=David Kahn (writer) |title=The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet |title-link=The Codebreakers |date=1966 |publisher=Macmillan and Sons |isbn=0684831309 |pages=743–751}}</ref> At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for [[Bell Telephone Labs]] entitled "A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography", dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as "[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]" in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously, and that "they were so close together you couldn't separate them".<ref>quoted in Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', p. 744.</ref> In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to "develop these results … in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information."<ref>Quoted in Erico Marui Guizzo, [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf "The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory"], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182200/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf |date=May 28, 2008 }} unpublished MS thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2003, p. 21.</ref>

While he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the [[cryptographic]] [[one-time pad]] is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in 1949. The same article also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1949.tb00928.x|title=Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems|year=1949|last1=Shannon|first1=C. E.|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|volume=28|issue=4|pages=656–715}}</ref>

===Information theory===
In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the ''Bell System Technical Journal''. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the message a sender wants to transmit. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure of the [[information]] content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message. In so doing, he essentially invented the field of [[information theory]].

The book ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication''<ref name=":0" /> reprints Shannon's 1948 article and [[Warren Weaver]]'s popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Weaver pointed out that the word "information" in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise''.

Information theory's fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] was further established in 1951, in his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English", showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English – giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating [[space (punctuation)|space]] as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

Another notable paper published in 1949 is "[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]", a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable cyphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theorem]], which he had derived as early as 1940,<ref>{{Cite conference |last1=Stanković |first1=Raromir S. |last2=Astola |first2=Jaakko T. |last3=Karpovsky |first3=Mark G. |date=September 2006 |title=Some Historic Remarks On Sampling Theorem |url=https://sites.bu.edu/mark/files/2018/02/196.pdf |conference=Proceedings of the 2006 International TICSP Workshop on Spectral Methods and Multirate Signal Processing}}</ref> and which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. He further wrote a paper in 1956 regarding coding for a noisy channel, which also became a classic paper in the field of information theory.<ref name=":16" /> However, also in 1956 he wrote a one-page editorial for the "IRE Transactions on Information Theory" entitled "The Bandwagon" which he began by observing: "Information theory has, in the last few years, become something of a scientific bandwagon" and which he concluded by warning: "Only by maintaining a thoroughly scientific attitude can we achieve real progress in communication theory and consolidate our present position."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shannon |first1=Claude E. |title=The Bandwagon |journal=IRE Transactions on Information Theory |date=1956 |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=3 |doi=10.1109/TIT.1956.1056774 |url=https://www.jonglage.net/theorie/notation/siteswap-avancee/refs/books/Claude%20Shannon%20-%20Collected%20Papers.pdf |access-date=18 February 2025}}</ref>

Claude Shannon's influence has been immense in the field, for example, in a 1973 collection of the key papers in the field of information theory, he was author or coauthor of 12 of the 49 papers cited, while no one else appeared more than three times.<ref name=":19">{{Cite book |last=McEliece |first=Robert J. |author-link=Robert McEliece |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ9fWH7fh3IC |title=The Theory of Information and Coding |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-83185-7 |edition=Student |series= |location=Cambridge |pages=13 |language=en}}</ref> Even beyond his original paper in 1948, he is still regarded as the most important post-1948 contributor to the theory.<ref name=":19" />

In May 1951, [[Mervin Kelly]] received a request from the director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], general [[Walter Bedell Smith]], regarding Shannon and the need for him, as Shannon was regarded as, based on "the best authority", the "most eminently qualified scientist in the particular field concerned".<ref name="Soni Goodman 2017 p. 63">{{cite book |last1=Soni |first1=J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gygsDwAAQBAJ&dq=special+cryptologic+advisory+group+claude+shannon&pg=PA196 |title=A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age |last2=Goodman |first2=R. |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-4767-6668-3 |pages=193–198 |language=en |access-date=}}</ref> As a result of the request, Shannon became part of the CIA's Special Cryptologic Advisory Group or SCAG.<ref name="Soni Goodman 2017 p. 63" />

In his time at Bell Labs, he also co-developed [[pulse-code modulation]] alongside [[Bernard M. Oliver]], and [[John R. Pierce]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Noll |first=A.

===Artificial Intelligence===
In 1950, Shannon designed and built, with the help of his wife, a learning machine named Theseus. It consisted of a maze on a surface, through which a mechanical mouse could move. Below the surface were sensors that followed the path of a mechanical mouse through the maze. After much trial and error, this device would learn the shortest path through the maze, and direct the mechanical mouse through the maze. The pattern of the maze could be changed at will.<ref name="MIT" />

[[Mazin Gilbert]] stated that Theseus "inspired the whole field of AI. This random trial and error is the foundation of artificial intelligence."<ref name="MIT">{{cite journal |last1=Klein |first1=Daniel |date=2019 |editor1-last=Dragoon |editor1-first=aLICE |title=Mighty mouse |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/12/19/138508/mighty-mouse/ |journal=MIT News |language=English |location=Cambridge Massachusetts |publisher=MIT Technology Review |issue=January/February |pages=6–7}}</ref>

Shannon wrote multiple influential papers on artificial intelligence, such as his 1950 paper titled "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess", and his 1953 paper titled "Computers and Automata".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cordeschi |first=Roberto |date=2007-04-25 |title=AI Turns Fifty: Revisiting ITS Origins |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08839510701252304 |journal=Applied Artificial Intelligence |language=en |volume=21 |issue=4–5 |pages=259–279 |doi=10.1080/08839510701252304 |issn=0883-9514}}</ref> Alongside [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], he co-edited a book titled ''Automata Studies'', which was published in 1956.<ref name=":16">{{Cite journal |last=Kline |first=Ronald |date=2011 |title=Cybernetics, Automata Studies, and the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5477410 |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=5–16 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2010.44 |issn=1058-6180}}</ref> The categories in the articles within the volume were influenced by Shannon's own subject headings in his 1953 paper.<ref name=":16" /> Shannon shared McCarthy's goal of creating a science of intelligent machines, but also held a broader view of viable approaches in automata studies, such as neural nets, Turing machines, cybernetic mechanisms, and symbolic processing by computer.<ref name=":16" />

Shannon co-organized and participated in the [[Dartmouth workshop]] of 1956, alongside John McCarthy, [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Nathaniel Rochester (computer scientist)|Nathaniel Rochester]], and which is considered the founding event of the field of artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=John |last2=Minsky |first2=Marvin L. |last3=Rochester |first3=Nathaniel |last4=Shannon |first4=Claude E. |date=2006-12-15 |title=A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, August 31, 1955 |url=https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1904 |journal=AI Magazine |language=en |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=12 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v27i4.1904 |issn=2371-9621}}</ref><ref name="Solomonoff"/>

===Teaching at MIT===
In 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty, holding an endowed chair. He worked in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978.

===Later life===
Shannon developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and spent the last few years of his life in a [[nursing home]]; he died in 2001, survived by his wife, a son and daughter, and two granddaughters.<ref name =SW>{{cite web| url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Shannon.html | title=Shannon, Claude Elwood (1916–2001) | first=Eric | last=Weisstein | work=World of Scientific Biography | publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/shannon_claude.htm | title=Claude Shannon – computer science theory | work=www.thocp.net | publisher=The History of Computing Project | access-date=December 9, 2016}}</ref>

Historian [[James Gleick]] noted the importance of Shannon, stating that "Einstein looms large, and rightly so. But we’re not living in the relativity age, we’re living in the information age. It’s Shannon whose fingerprints are on every electronic device we own, every computer screen we gaze into, every means of digital communication.

==''The Mathematical Theory of Communication''==

=== Weaver's Contribution ===
Shannon's ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication,''<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Shannon |first=Claude Elwood |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40716662 |title=The mathematical theory of communication |date=1998 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |others=Warren Weaver |isbn=0-252-72546-8 |location=Urbana |oclc=40716662}}</ref> begins with an interpretation of his own work by [[Warren Weaver]]. Although Shannon's entire work is about communication itself, Warren Weaver communicated his ideas in such a way that those not acclimated to complex theory and mathematics could comprehend the fundamental laws he put forth. The coupling of their unique communicational abilities and ideas generated the [[Shannon–Weaver model|Shannon-Weaver model]], although the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings emanate entirely from Shannon's work after Weaver's introduction. For the layman, Weaver's introduction better communicates ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'',<ref name=":0" /> but Shannon's subsequent logic, mathematics, and expressive precision was responsible for defining the problem itself.

"Theseus", created in 1950, was a mechanical mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it to move around a [[maze|labyrinth]] of 25 squares.<ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement">{{cite web |title=Bell Labs Advances Intelligent Networks |url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA!!?LMSG_CABINET=Bell_Labs&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features/News_Feature_Detail_000025 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722011711/http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/%21ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA%21%21?LMSG_CABINET=Bell_Labs&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features%2FNews_Feature_Detail_000025 |archive-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions.<ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement" /> The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior.<ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement" /> Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.<ref name="Bell Labs acknowledgement" />

===Shannon's estimate for the complexity of chess===
{{Main|Shannon number}}
In 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the [[Game complexity|game-tree complexity]] of [[chess]], which is approximately 10<sup>120</sup>. This number is now often referred to as the "[[Shannon number]]", and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity. The number is often cited as one of the barriers to [[Solving chess|solving the game of chess]] using an exhaustive analysis (i.e. [[Brute-force search|brute force analysis]]).<ref name="CS">{{cite journal | author = Claude Shannon | title = Programming a Computer for Playing Chess | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 41 | issue = 314 | year = 1950 | url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf | access-date = January 2, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100706211229/http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf | archive-date = July 6, 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|first=James|last=Grime|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km024eldY1A|title=How many chess games are possible?|publisher=Numberphile|date=July 24, 2015}}</ref>

===Shannon's computer chess program===
On March 9, 1949, Shannon presented a paper called "Programming a Computer for playing Chess". The paper was presented at the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to solve the game.<ref name="CS"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://billwall.phpwebhosting.com/articles/computer_early_chess.htm|title=Early Computer Chess Programs by Bill Wall|website=billwall.phpwebhosting.com}}</ref> In 1950, Shannon wrote an article titled "A Chess-Playing Machine",<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Shannon |first=Claude E. |date=1950 |title=A Chess-Playing Machine |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24967381 |journal=Scientific American |volume=182 |issue=2 |pages=48–51 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0250-48 |jstor=24967381 |pmid=15402252 |bibcode=1950SciAm.182b..48S |issn=0036-8733}}</ref> which was published in ''[[Scientific American]].'' Both papers have had immense influence and laid the foundations for future chess programs.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":13" />

His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a [[minimax]] procedure, based on an [[evaluation function]] of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. ''Material'' was counted according to the usual [[chess piece relative value]] (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen).<ref>{{Citation | title = Artificial Dreams: The Quest for Non-biological Intelligence | author = Hamid Reza Ekbia | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-87867-8 | page = 46 | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref> He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each [[doubled pawn]], [[backward pawn]], and [[isolated pawn]]; ''[[mobility (chess)|mobility]]'' was incorporated by adding 0.1 point for each legal move available.

===Shannon's maxim===
Shannon formulated a version of [[Kerckhoffs's principle|Kerckhoffs' principle]] as "The enemy knows the system". In this form it is known as "Shannon's maxim".

===Miscellaneous===
Shannon also contributed to [[combinatorics]] and [[detection theory]].<ref name=":17">{{Cite journal |last1=Effros |first1=Michelle |last2=Poor |first2=H. Vincent |date=2017 |title=Claude Shannon: His Work and Its Legacy |journal=EMS Newsletter |language=en |volume=2017-3 |issue=103 |pages=29–34 |doi=10.4171/NEWS/103/5 |issn=1027-488X|doi-access=free }}</ref> His 1948 paper introduced many tools used in combinatorics. He did work on detection theory in 1944, with his work being one of the earliest expositions of the “matched filter” principle.<ref name=":17" />

He was known as a successful investor who gave lectures on investing. A report from ''[[Barron's]]'' on August 11, 1986, detailed the recent performance of 1,026 mutual funds, and Shannon achieved a higher return than 1,025 of them. Comparing the portfolio of Shannon from the late 1950s to 1986, to [[Warren Buffett]]'s of 1965 to 1995, Shannon had a return of about 28% percent, compared to 27% for Buffett.{{sfn|Poundstone|2005|p=307}} One such method of Shannon's was labeled '''Shannon's demon''', which was to form a portfolio of equal parts cash and a stock, and rebalance regularly to take advantage of the stock's randomly jittering price movements.<ref name=":18">{{Cite book |last1=Benello |first1=Allen C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy3fCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA79 |title=Concentrated Investing: Strategies of the World's Greatest Concentrated Value Investors |last2=Biema |first2=Michael van |last3=Carlisle |first3=Tobias E. |date=2016 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-119-01204-7 |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |pages=79–81 |language=en}}</ref> Shannon reportedly long thought of publishing about investing, but ultimately did not, despite giving multiple lectures.<ref name=":18" /> He was one of the first investors to download stock prices, and a snapshot of his portfolio in 1981 was found to be $582,717.50, translating to $1.5 million in 2015, excluding another one of his stocks.<ref name=":18" />
