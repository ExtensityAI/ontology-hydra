What are the precise definitions of each type of scholarly output (e.g., journal article, preprint, thesis, dissertation, conference paper, book chapter, poster) and how are distinctions maintained in the ontology?
How does the ontology encode and differentiate between various publication statuses such as preprint, published, corrected, and retracted versions?
Which persistent identifiers are supported for research papers, contributors, organizations, and supplementary artefacts, and how does the ontology maintain authority control for these?
How are multilingual titles, abstracts, and keywords represented to facilitate robust discovery and accurate search across languages?
How are contributor roles (e.g., author, editor, reviewer, corresponding author) modeled, and how is the disambiguation of individuals with similar or identical names ensured?
What properties and relationships exist for mapping author affiliations over time, especially for contributors with multiple or changing institutional affiliations?
How does the ontology represent hierarchical and relational structures among organizations (e.g., parent/child institutions, consortia, partnerships)?
How are journals, conferences, and publishers uniquely identified, and how is editorial board or organizer metadata captured if available?
How are grants and funding information (agency, funder IDs, grant numbers, linkage to publications) captured and associated with research outputs?
What structures exist to support version tracking and citation linkage among different versions of the same work?
How are bibliographic and citation metadata (reference lists, citations received, inbound/outbound citations, citation counts) represented and linked?
What are the essential metadata fields required for discoverability, including open access status, licensing, embargo dates, and accessibility tags?
How does the ontology support the integration of controlled vocabularies and subject taxonomies, including mapping to systems like ACM CCS and MeSH?
What mechanisms are in place for representing author- and system-assigned keywords, including support for multilingual and regionally inclusive terms?
How are relationships between research outputs, such as direct citations, bibliographic coupling, co-authorship, and institutional collaborations, formally modeled?
How are supplementary artefacts (datasets, software code, figures, tables) referenced, and what metadata is required for their persistent linkage to publications?
How does the ontology handle the alignment and interoperability with domain standards such as Dublin Core, DataCite, Crossref, MARC, and schema.org?
What metadata structures are provided for faceted search, user personalization (tags, favorites, reading lists), and usability features while maintaining user privacy?
How are bibliometric and altmetric indicators linked to entities, and what constraints exist for their inclusion?
What are the rules and constraints for representing peer review and editorial status, given privacy and scope limitations?
How are research domains, fields, subfields, and interdisciplinary relationships hierarchically and flexibly classified in the ontology?
What provisions ensure that excluded content types (e.g., blogs, non-scholarly books, trade publications, preliminary data) do not enter the ontology?
How is compliance with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) ensured structurally within the ontology?
How does the ontology support mapping and updating to accommodate emerging scholarly output types and changing standards?
What are the explicit boundaries for including or excluding entities from adjacent domains (e.g., grant management, library systems, networking platforms)?
