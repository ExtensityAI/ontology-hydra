What are the precise definitions and distinguishing characteristics for each type of scholarly output (e.g., journal article, preprint, conference proceeding, thesis, dissertation, book chapter, poster, presentation) represented in the ontology?
How does the ontology represent the versioning and publication status of research outputs (e.g., preprint, published, corrected, retracted), and what properties and relationships distinguish these states?
What are the core metadata attributes required for each scholarly output, including multilingual titles, abstracts, keywords, publication details, and persistent identifiers?
How are contributors (authors, editors, reviewers, corresponding authors, etc.) modeled with role-specific metadata, persistent identifiers (e.g., ORCID), authority control, and affiliation history/disambiguation?
How does the ontology support tracking multiple affiliations for authors over time and representing historical affiliation data?
What controlled vocabularies and classification systems (e.g., ACM CCS, MeSH) are supported for subject tagging, and how are multilingual and inclusive subject tags implemented?
How is the hierarchical or relational structure among research domains, disciplines, and subfields represented and linked to research outputs?
What properties define institutions and organizations (universities, research centers, consortia), and how are persistent identifiers (e.g., ROR, GRID), hierarchical relationships, and partnerships represented?
How does the ontology model journals, conferences, publishers, and book series, including editorial boards and event-specific metadata such as ISSN/ISBN and event dates?
How are funding bodies and grant information represented, including persistent identifiers, project/grant metadata, and linkages between grants, institutions, and publications?
How are formal relationships between research outputs expressed (e.g., citation networks, bibliographic coupling, previous/next versions, inbound and outbound references)?
How does the ontology support the representation of collaboration and co-authorship networks, including organizational and project-based collaborations?
How are supplementary artefacts (datasets, software, code repositories, figures, tables) linked to research outputs using persistent identifiers and metadata references?
Which properties encode open access and licensing status, including embargo information, and how is this information standardized for search and filtering?
How are bibliometric indicators (citation counts, h-index, journal impact factors, altmetrics) modeled and associated directly with the relevant entities within the ontology?
What mechanisms are in place for integrating or mapping to external metadata and semantic interoperability standards (e.g., Dublin Core, Crossref, DataCite, MARC, schema.org), and how are these mappings maintained?
How does the ontology handle multilingual metadata for search and discoverability features, particularly for titles, abstracts, keywords, and subject taxonomies?
What is the scope and structure for faceted search and personalization metadata, such as user tags, favorites, and reading lists?
How are digital locations, archival holdings, repository links, and physical archive information for research outputs represented?
What authority control mechanisms are in place for the unique identification and disambiguation of all relevant entities (authors, organizations, funders, journals, etc.)?
How does the ontology address gray areas, such as inclusion criteria for preprints, supplementary materials, peer review metadata, and formally published educational outputs?
How are rights, licensing, and conditions of use detailed for research outputs, including standardized representation for machine-readable rights statements?
How does the ontology support alignment with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) in its core structures and metadata?
Which constraints or business rules ensure only formally declared and referenceable information is represented, preventing inclusion of excluded or out-of-scope content?
