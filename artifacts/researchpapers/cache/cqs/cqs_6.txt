What are the precise definitions and distinguishing characteristics of each research output type (peer-reviewed journal articles, preprints, conference proceedings, book chapters, theses, dissertations, monographs, and formally published posters or presentations) included in the ontology?
How are multilingual titles, abstracts, and keywords represented and linked in the metadata, and what standards are supported for multilingual content?
Which authority control and persistent identifier systems (e.g., ORCID, ROR, DOI, ISSN, ISBN) are supported for authors, contributors, institutions, publishers, and funders?
How does the ontology capture the roles, responsibilities, and granular contribution metadata for each contributor (e.g., author, editor, reviewer, corresponding author)?
What approaches are in place for disambiguating names and affiliations—especially for contributors with complex, multi-institutional, or international histories?
How are affiliations, hierarchical relationships (parent/child), and collaborations between institutions, organizations, and consortia modeled, including their persistent identifiers and historical changes?
How is publication versioning represented (e.g., preprints, accepted manuscripts, corrected or retracted versions), and what metadata distinguishes each status?
What mechanism links grants, projects, and funding bodies to specific publications, contributors, and institutions, including support for persistent funder and grant identifiers?
Which controlled vocabularies, subject taxonomies, or classification systems (e.g., ACM CCS, MeSH) are included, and how is mapping and multilingual/inclusive subject tagging supported?
How does the ontology distinguish between author-assigned and system-assigned keywords, and how are they associated with research outputs?
How is open access status, licensing (including embargoes and permissions), and rights metadata captured, especially for different output versions and supplementary artefacts?
What constraints ensure the exclusion of non-academic or non-scholarly materials, unreferenced research data, and personal/administrative records, consistent with the scope boundaries?
In what way are supplementary materials (datasets, code, figures, and other artefacts) referenced and linked to primary research outputs using persistent identifiers?
How are citation and bibliographic relationships (citations, inbound and outbound references, citation counts, bibliographic coupling) represented, and are bibliometric/altmetric indicators directly associated with entities?
What level of detail about peer review and editorial processes is supported (e.g., status metadata, open peer review reports where published)?
How does the ontology ensure compatibility with established metadata standards and schemas (e.g., Dublin Core, Crossref, MARC, DataCite, schema.org), and what mechanisms exist for schema mapping or extension?
How does the model achieve interoperability and alignment with FAIR principles, specifically regarding findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of metadata?
How are collaborative and cross-disciplinary relationships (co-authorship, institutional partnerships, interdisciplinary projects) identified and structured within the ontology?
What inclusivity measures support underrepresented languages, disciplines, and research outputs, both in controlled vocabularies and metadata completeness?
How are archive holdings, physical versus digital formats, and digital locations (URLs, repositories) differentiated and modeled for discoverability and preservation purposes?
What facets or structures are incorporated to enable advanced search, faceted discovery, personalized tagging, and reading list features while safeguarding system neutrality and privacy?
