What are the formal definitions for each type of scholarly output included (e.g., journal article, conference proceeding, preprint, thesis, book chapter, published poster)?
How are relationships between different versions of the same research output (preprint, published, corrected, retracted) represented and differentiated?
How does the ontology distinguish between the roles of contributors (e.g., author, editor, reviewer, corresponding author), and how is contribution metadata structured?
What mechanisms support disambiguation and authority control for author and contributor names, especially in multilingual and cross-cultural contexts?
How are institutional affiliations represented, including hierarchical relationships and changes over time for authors and organizations?
What classes of institutions and organizations are modeled (e.g., universities, research centers, consortia), and what are the key distinguishing attributes?
How are journals, publishers, book series, conferences, and their roles in the publication lifecycle classified and uniquely identified?
How are grants, funding agencies, and their relationships to specific research outputs and institutions modeled and linked?
What persistent identifiers are used for each core entity (authors, publications, institutions, funders, datasets, code), and how is their interoperability managed?
How does the ontology support multilingual metadata, including titles, abstracts, keywords, and subject classifications?
Which controlled vocabularies and subject taxonomies (e.g., ACM CCS, MeSH) are supported, and how are they integrated for classifying research outputs?
How are author-assigned vs. system-assigned keywords and classifications differentiated and reconciled?
What are the key fields of bibliographic metadata captured for each publication (e.g., title, authors, affiliations, publisher, publication date, identifiers, language, version, access status)?
How are open access and licensing metadata structured, and what distinctions are made between open, embargoed, and restricted access outputs?
How are links between publications and supplementary artefacts (datasets, code, figures) represented, with persistent identifiers and relation types?
How are citation relationships captured within the ontology (e.g., citations, references, inbound/outbound links, co-citation, bibliographic coupling)?
What attributes are provided for tracking citation counts, h-index values, journal impact factors, and other bibliometric indicators directly associated with outputs?
How does the ontology model co-authorship and collaboration networks, including cross-institutional and cross-national relationships?
In what ways are peer review and editorial board data included, and how are privacy and data minimization requirements met?
How does the ontology support faceted search and user personalization features (tags, favorites, reading lists), and how are these modeled?
What metadata and ontology structures facilitate cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary linking between topics and research fields?
How does the ontology handle the representation and mapping of outdated or historical nomenclature and classifications with contemporary standards?
What are the domain-specific constraints for inclusion or exclusion of supplementary materials, datasets, and software within research output metadata?
How are different language versions of the same publication or abstract connected and presented within the ontology?
How are embargoes, permissions, and rights metadata recorded and linked to publications for compliance with open science and licensing requirements?
Which metadata standards and schema mappings (e.g., Dublin Core, MARC, Crossref, DataCite, schema.org) are explicitly supported, and how is interoperability maintained?
How are institutional and organizational partnerships or collaborative grants linked to relevant research outputs?
What distinctions are made between formally published academic outputs and excluded non-academic, informal, or teaching materials?
How are borderline cases (e.g., preprints, conference posters, formally published presentations) classified and managed for search and retrieval?
What are the essential classification attributes for research domains, fields, subfields, and how are interdisciplinary and emerging domains accommodated?
How are academic networking indicators (e.g., co-author clusters, citation networks) represented to support bibliometric and impact analyses?
How does the ontology ensure persistent linkage of research outputs to their digital locations (URLs, repository entries, archives) across print and digital formats?
How are changes in institutional or author naming conventions over time reconciled within the ontology's authority control systems?
What metadata supports accessibility for non-English speakers and users with disabilities (e.g., alternative formats, multilingual tags)?
How does the ontology address gaps in representation for underrepresented languages, regions, or research areas?
What data quality and validation rules are in place to prevent duplicate records, name ambiguities, and inconsistent affiliations or identifiers?
How are user-contributed or system-assigned annotations, tags, or corrections managed and integrated with authoritative metadata?
How is the provenance and update history of metadata (e.g., corrections, retractions, status changes) tracked within the ontology?
