What are all the types of scholarly outputs represented in the ontology, and how are they distinguished (e.g., journal articles, conference proceedings, preprints, theses, book chapters, posters)?
How does the ontology support multilingual metadata fields, including original titles and translations, abstracts, and keywords?
What mechanisms are in place to ensure consistent categorization and classification of research papers across disciplines and languages?
How are author roles (author, editor, reviewer, corresponding author, etc.) represented, and how does the ontology manage standardized naming and authority control for contributors?
How does the ontology capture affiliation history and disambiguate between authors with similar names or multiple affiliations?
What persistent identifiers are supported for papers, authors, organizations, grants, and other core entities (e.g., DOI, ORCID, ROR, Funder Registry, ISSN, ISBN)?
How are different versions and statuses of research outputs (preprint, published, corrected, retracted) distinguished and linked?
How does the ontology link research papers with supplementary artefacts like datasets, software, and code repositories, and what metadata describes these relationships?
Which metadata fields are used for facilitating discoverability, advanced filtering, and personalization (e.g., subject classifications, user tags, reading lists, accessibility tags)?
How are subject classifications, controlled vocabularies, and taxonomies (e.g., ACM CCS, MeSH) integrated, and how is interdisciplinary or cross-domain research represented?
How are citation networks, referencing, bibliographic couplings, and topical similarity modeled between research papers?
How does the ontology represent institutional structures, partnerships, and collaboration networks among authors and organizations?
What information about funding bodies, grants, and their relationships to research outputs is included and how is this linked?
How does the ontology account for open access status, licensing, embargo information, and rights management for publications?
In what ways are accessibility and inclusivity (support for multiple languages, regionally diverse outputs, non-traditional research) handled in the ontology?
How are peer review and editorial board metadata represented, especially regarding publication status and open peer review reports?
How is bibliometric information (e.g., citation counts, journal metrics, altmetrics) associated with research outputs and limited to what is included in the scope?
What are the rules and constraints for including or excluding supplementary materials, educational content, and non-academic outputs?
How does the ontology ensure alignment with metadata standards and best practices (e.g., Dublin Core, Crossref, DataCite, MARC, schema.org, FAIR principles)?
What provisions exist in the ontology to support the evolving nature of research outputs and emerging collaborative or publication forms?
