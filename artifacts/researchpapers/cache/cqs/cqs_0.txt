What are the distinct types of research outputs covered, and how are they defined (e.g., journal articles, preprints, conference proceedings, theses, dissertations, book chapters, posters)?
How is versioning and publication status represented for research outputs (e.g., preprint, accepted manuscript, published version, corrected, retracted)?
What core metadata fields are required to describe each research output comprehensively (titles, abstracts, keywords, persistent identifiers, publication details, etc.)?
How does the ontology support multilingual content for titles, abstracts, keywords, and subject classifications?
Which persistent identifiers are modeled for outputs and entities (e.g., DOI, ORCID, ROR, ISSN, ISBN, Funder Registry), and how are they interrelated?
How are authors and contributors classified, and which roles (author, editor, reviewer, corresponding author, etc.) and contribution metadata are captured?
What mechanisms are in place for authority control and disambiguation of names for authors, institutions, and organizations?
How are affiliation histories and multi-institutional associations represented for contributors?
How are institutions and organizations structured hierarchically and relationally (parent/child, partnerships, consortia)?
How are details about journals, book series, conferences, publishers, and venues modeled, including their persistent identifiers and related metadata?
What classifications or taxonomies are supported for disciplines, fields, and subfields, and how does the ontology support both controlled vocabularies and author/system-assigned keywords?
How are relationships between research outputs, such as citations, references, co-authorship, and thematic similarity, represented in the ontology?
How are collaborative relationships between authors, institutions, and grants captured, including collaborative research, partnerships, and multi-author works?
What information is included regarding funding bodies, grants, and the linkage between grants/projects and publications?
How are bibliometric metadata and citation counts represented, including altmetrics, h-index, journal impact factors, and other indicators if directly linked to entities?
How are supplementary artefacts—such as datasets, software, figures, tables—linked and described within the ontology, considering only formally referenced items?
What licensing, open access, embargo, and rights metadata are modeled for each research output?
How does the ontology ensure interoperability with established metadata standards and schemas (e.g., Dublin Core, Crossref, MARC, DataCite, schema.org)?
What constraints exist regarding inclusion and exclusion of entities and relationships, particularly for borderline cases (e.g., preprints, supplementary materials, educational outputs)?
How are editorial and peer review statuses represented, noting the exclusion of detailed workflow or process data?
What accessibility and discoverability metadata are modeled to support faceted search, personalization, and multilingual queries?
How does the ontology support extensibility for integrating new types of scholarly outputs and emerging research dissemination mechanisms?
How are reference lists, inbound and outbound citations, and bibliographic couplings captured and structured to enable complex citation network analysis?
What explicit measures are taken to ensure authority control, harmonization of standards across contemporary and historical metadata, and ongoing vocabulary refinement?
How does the ontology address the mapping/alignment to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)?
