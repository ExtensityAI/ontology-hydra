What are the distinct types of research outputs included in the ontology and how are they formally differentiated (e.g., journal articles, preprints, theses, conference proceedings, book chapters, posters)?
How does the ontology model and distinguish between various publication statuses such as preprints, published versions, corrected articles, retracted papers, and others?
What metadata attributes and persistent identifiers are supported for each academic entity (e.g., DOI for papers, ORCID for authors, ROR for organizations, Funder IDs for grants)?
How are contributors' roles (author, editor, reviewer, corresponding author, etc.) represented, and how is contribution metadata captured, including author order and contribution statements?
What methods and standards does the ontology use to achieve authority control and disambiguation for authors and organizations, considering affiliation history and persistent identifiers?
In what way are relationships between research outputs (such as citations, references, bibliographic couplings, and corrections) characterized and structured within the ontology?
How does the ontology support multilingual metadata (titles, abstracts, keywords) and capture translations and original language information for research outputs?
What is the structure for linking research outputs to supplementary artefacts such as datasets, code repositories, figures, and tables, and how are these supplementary items referenced?
How are institutional and organizational hierarchies (parent/child, partnerships, consortia) represented, including changes over time and affiliations with contributors?
What controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are supported for subject classification, and how are hierarchical research domains and interdisciplinary fields modeled?
How does the ontology model funding agencies and grants, and what are the rules for linking grants/projects to affiliated research outputs and contributors?
How are publication outlets (journals, book series, conferences, publishers) detailed, including editorial boards, event details, and persistent identifiers (ISSN, ISBN, etc.)?
What bibliometric and altmetric indicators (citation counts, journal impact factor, h-index, etc.) are included, and under what conditions are they directly associated with indexed research outputs?
What is the framework for representing open access status, licensing information, embargo periods, and accessibility/usage rights, including the use of standard licensing schemas?
How does the ontology address the inclusion or exclusion of peer review metadata, especially for open peer review reports and editorial status?
What procedures are in place for representing collaboration and co-authorship networks, institutional partnerships, and grant-project-publication linkages?
How does the ontology ensure alignment and interoperability with established metadata standards and schemas (e.g., Dublin Core, Crossref, DataCite, MARC, schema.org)?
What support does the ontology provide for faceted search, personalization features (such as user tags, favorites, reading lists), and enhanced discoverability?
What are the primary domain-specific constraints and rules regarding the representation of research outputs, academic entities, and the exclusion of non-academic or personal data?
How does the ontology handle the integration and harmonization of contemporary and historical standards, and accommodate emerging research output types and new collaboration models?
