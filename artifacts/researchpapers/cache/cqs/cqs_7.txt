What types of research outputs (e.g., journal articles, conference papers, preprints, theses, posters) are formally defined within the ontology, and how are they distinguished from each other?
How does the ontology capture and differentiate between versions and statuses of research outputs (such as preprint, published, corrected, retracted)?
What metadata fields are defined to support multilingual content and how is language encoded for titles, abstracts, and keywords?
How are author and contributor roles (author, editor, reviewer, corresponding author) represented, and are persistent identifiers (e.g., ORCID) required for disambiguation?
How is affiliation history tracked for authors/contributors, and what mechanisms are in place to handle name changes or multiple simultaneous affiliations?
What standard identifiers (DOI, ISSN, ISBN, ORCID, ROR, funder IDs, ARK) are supported and how are they associated with their respective entities (e.g., publications, authors, organizations, funders)?
How does the ontology represent and relate academic organizations, including their hierarchical structures (parent/child), types (university, consortium), and relationships (partnerships, collaborations)?
What mechanisms ensure robust authority control and disambiguation for names of people, organizations, and venues across languages and regions?
How are funding bodies, grants, and their linkages to research outputs formally modeled, including metadata for grant numbers and project titles?
What are the essential properties associated with journals, publishers, conferences, and venues, and how are these entities uniquely identified?
How does the ontology enable discoverability, including support for faceted search, personalization (such as favorites or user tags), and accessibility features (e.g., language tags, alternative formats)?
What classification systems and controlled vocabularies (e.g., ACM CCS, MeSH) are included, and how does the ontology support hierarchical, interdisciplinary, and multilingual classification of research topics?
How are citation and bibliographic networks represented, including inbound/outbound references, citation counts, co-authorship, and inter-institutional collaborations?
What metadata is defined for open access status, licensing, embargo periods, and conditions of use for each research output?
How are supplementary artefacts (datasets, code, figures) associated with research outputs, and what constraints exist for including only referenced/supporting material?
How are bibliometric indicators (citation counts, journal impact factors, altmetrics) captured and linked to their respective entities, while ensuring only directly associated metrics are included?
How does the ontology ensure interoperability and compliance with established metadata standards and semantic web best practices (Dublin Core, Crossref, DataCite, schema.org, FAIR principles)?
What properties and constraints are defined to capture peer review status, editorial board information, and publication workflow stages, while respecting privacy and excluding process data?
How does the ontology handle updates and authority alignment with evolving standards (new persistent identifiers, emerging research output types, changes in classification systems)?
What exclusion rules are formalized to ensure only academic, formally published, and referenceable materials are included (excluding non-scholarship, raw data, administrative records, educational materials)?
