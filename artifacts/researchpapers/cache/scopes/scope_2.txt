      - Research groups and labs
      - National and international funding bodies
   2.5 Funding and Grants
      - Grant numbers and identifiers
      - Funding agency metadata
      - Links between publications and specific grant projects
   2.6 Citations and References
      - Internal and external citations
      - Bibliographic reference metadata
      - Citation counts and bibliometrics
   2.7 Research Topics and Keywords
      - Author-provided and standardized subject keywords
      - Taxonomies and controlled vocabularies (e.g., MeSH, ACM CCS)
   2.8 Publication Metadata
      - Publisher details
      - Open access status and licensing (e.g., CC-BY, embargo periods)
      - ISSN, ISBN, and other standard identifiers
      - Language of publication; multi-language metadata
   2.9 Associated Research Artefacts
      - Supplementary datasets
      - Code repositories (e.g., GitHub links)
      - Figures and tables
      - Peer review history (if available)
   2.10 Interoperability & Standards
      - Use of ontologies (e.g., Dublin Core, RDF, schema.org)
      - Compliance with open data and privacy regulations
      - Support for linked data and semantic web protocols

3. Explicit Exclusions
   - Full-text retrieval, storage, and rights management for content behind paywalls (outside indexing metadata)
   - Non-academic content (e.g., blogs, news articles, literary fiction)
   - Patent documentation and legal case studies
   - Fine-grained user access logs or analytics unrelated to academic content
   - Non-research outputs (e.g., course syllabi, administrative documents, event flyers)
   - Internal university records unrelated to research output
   - Personal data of researchers beyond professional identifiers and affiliations (per data privacy standards)

4. Gray Areas and Overlaps
   - Datasets: Standalone research datasets may belong in a related but separate repository; include only references and descriptive metadata when linked to a publication.
   - Code repositories and software: Include references and identifiers (e.g., DOI for software) when directly associated with a paper, but not the full software archives.
   - Peer review reports: Include where openly available; may overlap with open peer review platforms not strictly tied to publications.
   - Preprints: Covered when represented as papers, but ongoing versions and comments outside the publication scope.
   - Conference presentations and posters: Included only if they result in or are formally linked to a publication.
   - Bibliometric measures: Store citation and impact data when directly tied to entities, but not advanced analytics workflows or proprietary algorithmic scores.

5. Adjacent Domains
   - Institutional repositories and research data management systems
   - Grant management and reporting systems
   - Academic job or researcher profiling platforms
   - Bibliometric and altmetric analytics platforms

6. Shared Vocabulary and Terminology
   - Ensure use of standard controlled vocabularies for authors, subjects, and organizations.
   - Prioritize persistent identifiers (DOI, ORCID, ROR, Funder Registry, etc.) for interoperability.
   - Adhere to international metadata schemas and encourage multilingual support.
