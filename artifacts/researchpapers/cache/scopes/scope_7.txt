1. Domain Definition
- Research papers and their related academic entities and concepts, for use in developing a searchable academic database.

2. Included Topics
2.1 Research Papers
  - Full text, abstracts, titles, and keywords
  - Publication metadata (authors, publication date, DOI, journal/conference name)
  - Citation information (references, cited-by)
  - Versions and preprints
2.2 Academic Entities
  - Authors (names, affiliations, identifiers such as ORCID)
  - Institutions/affiliations (universities, research centers)
  - Journals and conferences
  - Publishers
2.3 Core Concepts
  - Research topics, fields, and academic disciplines
  - Keywords and subject classifications
  - Relationships between papers (e.g., citation, co-authorship, thematic similarity)
2.4 Supporting Entities
  - Funding sources and grants
  - Datasets and supplementary materials referenced in papers
  - Reviews and peer commentary
2.5 User-Focused Features
  - Personalization attributes (user tags, favorites, reading lists)
  - Accessibility tags (language, alternative formats)

3. Excluded Topics
  - Non-academic publications (news articles, blog posts, patents unrelated to papers)
  - Commercial or trade literature not peer-reviewed
  - Internal communications (emails, memos)
  - Experimental data not explicitly referenced or linked in papers
  - User private behavioral data (outside personalization features)

4. Gray Areas & Overlaps
  - Interdisciplinary research: overlapping with multiple academic domains and may challenge strict classification
  - Preprints and non-peer-reviewed work: included if widely used within academic communities
  - Science communication articles: included only if published in academic venues
  - Education materials (e.g., course syllabi): generally excluded, unless formally indexed as research outputs

5. Vocabulary and Scope Boundaries
  - Core vocabulary centers on published academic research outputs and entities directly connected to their discoverability
  - Direct effort made to include concepts supporting accessibility and personalization to enhance database usability
