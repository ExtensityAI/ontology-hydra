1. Domain Overview
   - Research papers, their related academic entities, and concepts as represented in a searchable database

2. Included Topics
   2.1 Research Paper Core Metadata
      - Title
      - Authors (including affiliations, ORCID, roles)
      - Abstracts (including multi-language support)
      - Keywords and subject tags
      - Publication date
      - Journal, conference, or repository of publication
      - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and other persistent identifiers
      - Cited references and citation count
      - Language(s) of publication
      - Access type (open access, embargoed, subscription-based)

   2.2 Academic Entities
      - Authors (individuals, collaborative groups)
      - Institutions and affiliations (universities, research centers, etc.)
      - Publishers and repositories (journals, digital archives, preprint servers)
      - Conferences and scholarly events
      - Funding bodies and grant information
      - Editorial boards and peer reviewers (limited to identification, not performance metrics)

   2.3 Key Concepts and Relationships
      - Research domains/disciplines
      - Subject classifications and taxonomies (e.g., MeSH, ACM CCS, local vocabularies)
      - Citation and reference links (including citation networks)
      - Keywords, controlled vocabularies, and tagging systems
      - Interlinking non-English and multilingual academic content
      - Relationships: authorship, institutional affiliation, sponsorship, citation, keyword association

   2.4 Enabling Structures
      - Metadata standards and schemas (e.g., Dublin Core, MARC, Crossref, DataCite)
      - Semantic web/linked data integration (e.g., RDF, ontologies)
      - User interaction tags (search keywords, usage analytics, etc., as abstracted metadata)
      - Accessible representations (multi-lingual support, accessibility tags)

3. Explicitly Excluded
   - Full research paper content (i.e., main body text, figures, datasets, unless referenced as external entities)
   - Proprietary or sensitive author/reviewer information (e.g., private notes, peer review comments)
   - Detailed peer review process documentation/outcomes
   - Non-academic publications, media, or non-scholarly web sources
   - Learning materials, textbooks, or popular science articles
   - Internal operational/administrative records of institutions (not referenced in publication metadata)
   - Non-bibliographic data unrelated to research outputs (e.g., lab notebooks, raw experimental data unless formally published)
   
4. Gray Areas and Overlaps
   - Preprints and accepted manuscripts: included if formally catalogued as research outputs; pre-publication versions may straddle inclusion boundaries
   - Research datasets: Included only if formally cited/referenced within a paper’s metadata; full dataset records are out of scope
   - Supplemental materials (e.g., appendices, code): included only as metadata references, not full integration
   - Scholarly metrics (e.g., h-index, journal impact factor): referenced as external indicators, not fully modeled
   - Education-focused content (lesson plans, slides): excluded unless tied directly to research publication records
   
5. Adjacent Domains
   - Library management systems and catalog operations (covered only as they intersect with research paper metadata)
   - Grant and funding application systems (funding information included only as publication metadata, not as standalone entities)
   - Author network analysis and social scholarly platforms (overlap with citation and authorship data)
   - Legal and intellectual property entities (licenses and access rights included, but not full copyright or legal case modeling)
