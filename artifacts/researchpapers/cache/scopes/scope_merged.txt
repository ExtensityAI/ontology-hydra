1. Introduction and Domain Definition
1.1 Purpose and Scope
- This ontology provides a comprehensive, structured representation of research papers, their related academic entities, and associated concepts to facilitate inclusion in a searchable academic database.
- The ontology emphasizes discoverability, precise integration, nuanced metadata, and interoperability of scholarly outputs (journal articles, preprints, conference proceedings, book chapters, theses, dissertations) along with contributors, organizations, funding, and related artefacts.
- The scope extends to formally published outputs in print and digital formats, with support for multilingual content and cross-disciplinary inclusiveness.

1.2 Applicability
- The ontology’s primary applicability is scholarly communication; it captures intricate relationships and metadata supporting output discovery, impact analysis, and academic networking.
- It includes academic outputs in various languages, focusing on published works, and promotes discoverability for both contemporary and historical research outputs.

2.4 Concepts and Classification
  - Controlled vocabularies and subject taxonomies (ACM CCS, MeSH, etc.)
  - Hierarchical classifications: research domains, disciplines, fields, and subfields
  - Author- and system-assigned keywords
  - Multilingual and inclusive metadata for subject tags
  - Relationships between topics, fields, and interdisciplinary research

2.5 Research Output Relationships
  - Citation networks (citations, references, bibliographic couplings)
  - Collaboration and co-authorship networks
  - Institutional partnerships and collaborative relationships
  - Grant-project-publication linkages
  - Associations with supplementary artefacts (datasets, software, code, visual artefacts with persistent identifiers)
  - Links to altmetrics and bibliometric indicators (h-index, journal impact factors, altmetrics)—included only if directly associated with indexed entities
  - Thematic and topical similarity (via keywords/classifications)

2.6 Metadata Standards, Interoperability, and Enabling Structures
  - Adoption and mapping to established schemas (Dublin Core, Crossref, DataCite, MARC, schema.org)
  - Persistent identifiers and authority control (ORCID, DOI, ROR, ISSN, ISBN, Funder Registry, etc.)
  - Semantic web technologies (RDF, ontological mappings), support for linked data integration
  - Rights and licensing metadata (open access, embargo, permissions)
  - Accessibility and discoverability metadata (multi-language, conditions of use)
  - Alignment with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
  - Metadata structures facilitating indexing, analytics, and usability features (excluding system implementation details)

3. Explicit Exclusions
3.1 Non-Academic and Non-Scholarly Content
  - Informal or popular media (blogs, news articles, magazines, non-scholarly books)
  - Commercial reports, trade publications, social media, and community discussions unless directly cited by scholarly work
3.2 Unstructured and Raw Research Data
  - Laboratory notebooks, preliminary datasets, and private notes unless formally referenced as supplementary to a publication
  - Complete research data management outside the context of publication linkage
3.3 Administrative, Operational, and Personal Data
  - Internal institutional records (HR, student evaluations, financial transactions not linked to grants)
  - Personal or biographical information beyond professional affiliations and persistent academic identifiers
3.4 Intellectual Property and Patent Records
  - Patent filings, commercialization records, and legal/corporate documents unless explicitly referenced in academic outputs
3.5 Technical Implementation Details

  - Standalone datasets or software excluded unless formally cited as part of a research output
4.3 Peer Review Metadata
  - Open peer review reports included only when formally published and linked to a research paper; process data present only as publication status metadata
4.4 Metrics and Impact Assessment

4.6 Adjacent and Overlapping Domains (Reference Only)
  - Institutional repository and grant management systems included to the extent they intersect with referenced research outputs
  - Bibliometric and academic networking platforms included only for relevant entity/citation data
  - Library and information retrieval systems referenced only where intersecting with publication metadata

5. Vocabulary, Standards, and Interoperability Principles
5.1 Shared Vocabulary and Terminology
  - Authority control for all names and identifiers (ORCID, ROR, DOI, ISSN, ISBN, Funder Registry, etc.)
  - Usage of controlled vocabularies for classification of authors, subjects, organizations, and publication types
  - Multilingual support and regionally inclusive nomenclature for metadata fields
  - Harmonization of contemporary and historical standards/classifications
  - Ongoing refinement for coverage of emerging research output types and collaborative forms

5.2 Standards and Best Practices
  - Adherence to metadata and semantic interoperability standards (Dublin Core, Crossref, MARC, DataCite, schema.org)
  - Alignment with FAIR data practices

6. Boundary Clarifications and Implementation Notes
- The ontology targets enhancement of discoverability, interoperability, and extensibility for research output metadata and relationships.
- Technical implementation details (API schemas, front-end designs) are out of scope but inform requirements for extensibility.
- Only formally declarable and referenceable information from the scholarly publishing ecosystem is included, per accepted privacy, copyright, and open science standards.
- Non-academic content, internal or personal data, unreferenced supplementary materials, and detailed workflow or analytics data are systematically excluded to maintain domain fidelity and clarity.
