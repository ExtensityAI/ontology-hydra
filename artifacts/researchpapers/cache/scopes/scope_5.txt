1. Included Scope: Key Topics within the Domain
   1.1 Research Papers
   - Manuscript metadata (title, abstract, keywords)
   - Authorship details (authors, affiliations, corresponding author)
   - Publication details (journal, conference, publisher, publication date)
   - Article identifiers (DOI, ISSN, ISBN)
   - Versions and preprints
   - Languages and multilingual content
   1.2 Academic Entities
   - Authors and contributors (with persistent identifiers, e.g., ORCID)
   - Research institutions (universities, labs, organizations)
   - Funders and grant identifiers
   - Journals, conferences, and proceedings
   - Editorial boards and reviewers (optional metadata)
   1.3 Related Concepts and Relationships
   - Citations and references (inbound/outbound)
   - Subject classifications/taxonomies (e.g., ACM CCS, MeSH)
   - Keywords and research topics
   - Peer review status and open peer review metadata
   - Open access status, licensing, and usage rights
   - Research data links and supplementary materials
   - Acknowledgments and conflict of interest disclosures
   1.4 Technical and Discovery Aspects
   - Metadata standards (e.g., Dublin Core, DataCite, Crossref)
   - Persistent identifiers and interoperability mechanisms
   - Multilingual metadata and accessibility considerations
   - Compliance with FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

2. Explicitly Excluded from Scope
   - Full text of research papers (only metadata and structure considered)
   - Educational materials (e.g., textbooks, lecture notes)
   - Non-academic content (blogs, news articles, informal communications)
   - Patents and intellectual property unrelated to publication metadata
   - Laboratory notebooks, raw data files, or datasets not linked as supplementary to publications
   - Non-research outputs (e.g., press releases, institutional reports not peer-reviewed)
   - Proprietary publisher internal workflows, unless relevant to metadata exposed for discoverability

3. Gray Areas and Overlaps
   - Conference presentations and posters: Included if formally published with identifiers or metadata; otherwise, considered out of scope
   - Preprints and non-peer-reviewed versions: Included if they support discoverability and have valid identifiers (arXiv, SSRN, etc.)
   - Data publications and research datasets: Included only if explicitly linked to research papers in the ontology (not as standalone data repositories)
   - Peer review reports: Included as metadata if publicly accessible and tied to research papers (open peer review)
   - Author and institution profiles: Included only in relation to their role in publications (not comprehensive CV or full institutional structures)
   - Licensing metadata: Included only to the extent that it pertains to article discoverability, rights, or reuse

4. Boundary Clarifications
   - The ontology prioritizes interoperability (linked data, standard identifiers) and open science compliance
   - Focus is on metadata that directly enhances the discoverability and navigation of scholarly publications
   - User experience requirements and technical implementation details (APIs, interface design) are not directly included in the ontology but may inform its extensibility
