1. Included Topics
   1.1. Research Papers
     - Scholarly articles, conference papers, dissertations, and preprints in academic domains
     - Published in print, digital, and open-access formats
     - Multilingual and non-English language outputs
   1.2. Academic Entities
     - Authors, co-authors, editors, and contributors (including affiliations and roles)
     - Journal titles, conference proceedings, book series
     - Publishers, university presses, and research institutions
     - Funding agencies and grant identifiers
   1.3. Core Metadata and Identifiers
     - Titles, abstracts, keywords, and subject classifications
     - Persistent identifiers: DOI, ISBN, ISSN, ORCID, funder IDs
     - Publication dates and versioning information
     - Citation data (references, citations received, bibliographies)
   1.4. Multilingual and Inclusive Metadata
     - Multilingual titles, abstracts, and keywords
     - Subject headings and controlled vocabularies for non-English disciplines
     - Categorizations to support underrepresented research domains
   1.5. Access and Availability
     - Licensing and permissions (open access, embargo, subscription status)
     - Digital object locations (URLs, repository links)
     - Physical and digital archive holdings
   1.6. Cross-Disciplinary and Linked Entities
     - Related projects, datasets, software, protocols, supplementary materials
     - Collaborations and interdisciplinary topics
     - Mappings to established metadata standards (Dublin Core, MARC, schema.org, etc.)

2. Explicitly Excluded Topics
   2.1. Non-Academic Outputs
     - Popular media articles, magazines, blogs, non-scholarly books
     - Unmoderated or non-peer-reviewed web content
   2.2. Personal Data Irrelevant to Research
     - Private contact information (home addresses, non-professional phone numbers)
     - Personal identifiers not linked to academic activity
   2.3. Detailed Workflow Processes
     - Peer review processes, editorial decision tracking
     - Submission workflows, manuscript management system internals
   2.4. Commercial, Patent, and Legal Documents
     - Patent filings, legal case documents
     - Corporate whitepapers outside academic discourse

3. Gray Areas and Overlaps
   3.1. Adjacent Domains
     - Institutional repository management: overlaps in archival, but not full internal workflows
     - Academic social networking platforms: user profiles and interactions mostly excluded, but publication listings may be relevant
     - Grant proposals: metadata about funded projects included, full proposals excluded
   3.2. Edge Cases
     - Conference posters and presentations: included if formally published or citable
     - Theses/dissertations: included if catalogued by an academic institution
     - Research data: linked and described, but detailed schema for datasets beyond scope
   3.3. Borderline Content Types
     - Preprints: included when persistent identifiers and academic credentials are present
     - Non-traditional scholarly outputs (software, multimedia): included if peer-reviewed or referenced in formal publications

This scope establishes the foundation for a shared vocabulary, emphasizing coverage of research outputs and their essential academic entities, with sensitivity to multilingual representation and cross-disciplinary inclusiveness, while explicitly limiting the domain to maintain metadata clarity and interoperability.
