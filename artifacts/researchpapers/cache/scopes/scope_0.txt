2. Explicit Exclusions from the Domain
   2.1 Non-Academic Content
      - Blog posts, promotional material, news articles not designated as scholarly publishing
      - Informal discussions (e.g., social media threads, comment sections)
   2.2 Primary Research Data
      - Raw experimental datasets (unless explicitly supplementary or referenced by papers)
      - Lab notebooks and unstructured private notes
   2.3 Internal Administrative Data
      - Human resource records, student evaluations, institutional financial data
      - Internal grant application details not published or associated with research outputs
   2.4 Patent and Commercialization Data
      - Patent filings and commercial product records (unless cited by academic literature)

3. Gray Areas and Overlaps
   3.1 Preprints and Non-Peer-Reviewed Works
      - Inclusion of preprints can blur lines with informal literature; only included if intended for scholarly dissemination
   3.2 Supplementary Materials
      - Inclusion of data, code, and multimedia only if formalized as part of the publication record
   3.3 Altmetrics and Digital Scholarship
      - Online engagement metrics are included when directly tied to scholarly outputs, but general social media metrics are excluded
   3.4 Researcher Profiles
      - Author profiles are included insofar as they contribute to the context and network of academic publishing; extended biographical or personal data are excluded
   3.5 Funding and Impact Reporting
      - Grant and funding metadata are included if linked to research publications; broader policy documents or funding agency internal reports are excluded

4. Adjacent Domains (For Reference Only)
   - Research data management systems
   - Institutional repository infrastructure
   - Knowledge graphs and scientific knowledge bases
   - Academic networking platforms (author and institution profiles)

This scope document defines the foundational boundary for structuring a searchable database of research papers and related academic concepts and entities. It supports clear delineation of included and excluded content, with notes on overlapping and adjacent areas for potential future integration or reference.
