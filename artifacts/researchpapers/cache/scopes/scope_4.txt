      - Financial transaction details (beyond grant funding metadata)

3. Gray Areas and Overlapping Domains
   3.1. Digital Tools and Data Sets
      - Research data sets and software: Included if directly referenced by research papers; excluded otherwise
      - Digital humanities corpora or databases: In scope only when linked to academic outputs
   3.2. Educational Materials
      - Course syllabi and lecture content: Excluded unless published as academic research
   3.3. Non-traditional Publications
      - Working papers and preprints: Included, but standards of metadata may vary

   3.4. Metadata Standards and Interoperability
      - Crosswalks to other ontologies and interoperability schemes: Not core, but adjacent and relevant for implementation

4. Shared Vocabulary and Boundaries
   - Emphasis on comprehensive representation of academic outputs across languages, regions, and disciplines
   - Focus on metadata quality, clear entity typing (e.g., distinguishing author roles, publication types)
   - Recognition of historical and contemporary citation norms across fields
   - Explicit exclusion of non-research and non-academic publication types
   - Support for ongoing vocabulary refinement to address emerging types of research outputs and collaboration forms
