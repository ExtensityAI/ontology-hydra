1. Included Topics

1.1 Research Papers
  - Bibliographic metadata (title, abstract, keywords, DOI, publication date)
  - Authorship and contributor roles (author, corresponding author, editor)
  - Document types (preprints, journal articles, conference papers, theses/dissertations, reviews)
  - Publication details (journal, conference, publisher, volume, issue, pages)
  - Language of publication
  - Versioning (pre-print, accepted manuscript, published version)
  - Citation networks (references, cited by, citation counts)
  - Associated datasets, code, or supplementary materials
  - Persistent identifiers (DOI, ORCID, ISBN, ISSN)
  - Abstracts and summaries

1.2 Related Academic Entities
  - Authors and contributors (profiles, affiliations, identifiers)
  - Institutions and organizations (universities, research centers, funders)
  - Journals, conferences, and publishers (name, identifiers, impact metrics)
  - Funding bodies and grant information
  - Subject classifications and disciplinary taxonomies (e.g. keywords, fields of study)
  - Peer review entities/reviewers (as metadata, where appropriate)
  - Research projects (titles, descriptions, project IDs)

1.3 Metadata and Standards
  - Metadata schemas (Dublin Core, Crossref, DataCite, etc.)
  - Rights and licensing metadata (copyright, open access status, Creative Commons, embargo periods)
  - Usage permissions and access conditions
  - Institutional reporting fields (publication output types, compliance fields)
  - FAIR data principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability)

1.4 System and Usability Concepts
  - Searchability (indexing, full-text search, faceted filters, query mechanisms)
  - Interoperability mechanisms (APIs, integrations with external scholarly databases)
  - Visual analytic elements (co-authorship graphs, citation maps)
  - Provenance and audit trails (data sources, record modifications)

2. Explicitly Excluded Topics

2.1 Non-academic Works
  - Popular press articles, blog posts, non-peer-reviewed content
  - Non-scholarly grey literature unless cited as part of academic research

2.2 Non-research Entities
  - Student coursework, lecture notes, and teaching materials
  - Administrative documents unrelated to research output

2.3 Technical Implementation Details
  - Graph database platform specifics (installation, configuration)
  - Machine learning pipeline internals (unless directly relevant to metadata)
  - Software code not directly associated with a research paper

2.4 Detailed Content Analysis
  - Informatics on the full body text (such as NLP annotations, topic modeling details)
  - Direct analysis of datasets (focus remains on relationships to papers, not dataset content)

2.5 Purely Commercial or Patent Documentation
  - Patent filings unless directly referenced within a research paper
  - Commercial product documentation unrelated to scholarly communication

3. Gray Areas and Overlaps

3.1 Overlaps with Adjacent Domains
  - Research data management (overlaps when datasets/software are directly tied to papers)
  - Institutional repositories (shared entities: papers, authors, organizations)
  - Intellectual property and licensing (gray zone: handling rights statements, embargoes)
  - Academic social networks (overlap regarding author profiles and affiliations)
  - Grant management systems (intersects at the project and funding entity level)

3.2 Acknowledgement of Edge Cases
  - Theses/dissertations: Included if part of institutional research outputs
  - Conference posters and presentations: Included where catalogued in repositories/published proceedings
  - Book chapters: Included if scholarly and refereed
  - Preprints: Included, with versioning distinctions
  - Datasets/code repositories: Included as related entities when associated with a paper, but not covered comprehensively on their own

3.3 Evolving Areas
  - Open peer review and review reports (included where formally linked to papers)
  - Rights metadata complexity: Embargoes, dual-licensed works, and hybrid publications may require nuanced representation (boundary with legal ontologies)

4. Terminology Boundaries
  - Emphasis on precise use of research paper-related vocabulary (avoid generic or ambiguous terms)
  - Authority control for names and identifiers where possible
  - Standardization referencing common academic metadata frameworks (e.g. Crossref, ORCID, ROR, DataCite, Unpaywall)

This scope document establishes the shared vocabulary and boundaries for representing research papers, their associated academic entities, and related metadata, focusing on their discoverability, usability, legal status, and integration in a searchable database.
