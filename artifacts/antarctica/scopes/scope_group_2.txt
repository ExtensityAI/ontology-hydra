  - General atmospheric studies are excluded unless directly related to Antarctic conditions.

- **Environmental Policy**
  - Discussions on policy are included only insofar as they relate to scientific findings and Indigenous knowledge integration.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Climate Science Terminology
- **Global Warming:** Increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Ice Melt:** The process of glaciers and ice caps melting, contributing to sea level rise.
- **Ecosystem Vulnerability:** The susceptibility of an ecosystem to harmful changes due to climate change.

### 2.2 Oceanographic Terms
- **Thermohaline Circulation:** Large-scale ocean currents driven by temperature and salinity differences.
- **Biodiversity:** The variety of life in a particular ecosystem, important for ecosystem resilience.

### 2.3 Glaciological Concepts
- **Ice Core Sampling:** Technique to study past climates by extracting cylinders of ice from glaciers.
- **Isotopic Analysis:** Method used to determine the composition of isotopes in ice core samples to infer historical temperature changes.

### 2.4 Indigenous Knowledge Concepts
- **Kaitiakitanga:** Māori concept of guardianship and protection of the environment, embodying stewardship practices.
- **Mātauranga Māori:** Traditional Māori knowledge encompassing cultural, spiritual, and environmental wisdom.

### 2.5 Cross-disciplinary Terms
- **Citizen Science:** Public participation in scientific research, contributing data collection and analysis.
- **Climate Models:** Computational tools used to simulate climate systems and project future changes.

By establishing these boundaries and terminology, we aim to facilitate clear discussions and a mutual understanding among researchers, policymakers, and indigenous representatives engaged in Antarctic studies.
