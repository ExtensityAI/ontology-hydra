# Scope Document for the Domain of Antarctica

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Topics
- **Ecological Systems**
  - Terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity
  - Invasive species and their impact on endemic flora
  - Microbial communities in glacial systems
- **Climate Change Impact**
  - Effects of climate warming on glacial and terrestrial ecosystems
  - Adaptation and resilience of species in changing environments
- **Glaciology**
  - Glacial structure and dynamics
  - Ice melt and its contribution to global sea level rise
- **Environmental Policy**
  - Climate policy related to Antarctic ecosystems
  - Environmental justice and indigenous community impacts
- **Eco-Tourism**
  - Responsible travel practices in Antarctica
  - Educational eco-tourism initiatives and community engagement

### 1.2 Excluded Topics
- **Non-Scientific Aspects**
  - Cultural aspects unrelated to ecological and environmental science (e.g., literature, arts specific to Antarctica)
  - Political relationships not directly related to environmental issues
- **Technological Innovations Outside Ecology**
  - Broad technology development in sectors unrelated to environmental monitoring or conservation
  - Non-ecological aspects of tourism, such as travel marketing strategies

### 1.3 Gray Areas
- **Art and Science**
  - Intersection of art inspired by Antarctic landscapes with environmental messaging may be included but requires careful consideration of scientific relevance.
- **Local Culture and History**
  - Aspects of indigenous culture related to environmental practices may be included, but broader historical narratives about the region are excluded unless they inform current ecological or environmental discussions.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Ecological Terminology
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem.
- **Endemic Species**: Species that are native to and restricted to a specific geographic location.
- **Invasive Species**: Non-native species that adversely affect the ecosystems they invade.

### 2.2 Climate and Glaciology Terminology
- **Cryosphere**: The portions of Earth's surface where water is in solid form (ice).
- **Glacial Retreat**: The process of glaciers shrinking in size due to melting or calving.
- **Sea Level Rise**: The increase in the average level of the oceans as a result of climate change.

### 2.3 Environmental Policy and Justice
- **Climate Policy**: Strategies and regulations aimed at addressing climate change.
- **Environmental Justice**: Fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people in environmental decision-making.

### 2.4 Eco-Tourism Terminology
- **Sustainable Tourism**: Tourism that is environmentally friendly and socially responsible, ensuring minimal impact.
- **Educational Tours**: Travel experiences designed to inform participants about ecological and environmental issues.

### 2.5 Miscellaneous Terminology
- **Microbial Diversity**: The variety of microorganisms present in a given environment.
- **Genetic Analysis**: Techniques used to study DNA and genetic variation in organisms.

This document establishes a shared vocabulary and clear boundaries of the Antarctica domain for ongoing discussions and studies among the collaborative team focused on its ecological and environmental significance.
