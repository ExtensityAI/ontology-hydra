  - Climate science unrelated to polar conditions

- **Industrial Exploitation of Resources**
  - Discussions or actions related to resource extraction (e.g., mining, fishing) that are not aligned with conservation

- **Political and Territorial Issues**
  - Focused discussions on sovereignty disputes or territorial claims in Antarctica

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps with Adjacent Domains
- **Climate Change Research**
  - While Antarctic climate studies are included, broader climate issues affecting non-polar regions are outside the scope.
  
- **Global Ocean Studies**
  - While marine biology in Antarctica is included, wider oceanographic studies concerning global oceans may not be explicitly covered.

- **Environmental Policy and Ethics**
  - Discussions surrounding ethics in environmental policy may touch on but are not confined to Antarctic issues.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Geography and Environment
- **Antarctic Region**: The southernmost continent, encompassing areas south of the Antarctic Circle, characterized by ice, unique ecosystems, and extreme weather conditions.
- **Polarity**: Pertaining to the geographic poles of the Earth, particularly emphasizing environmental and climatic conditions in cold regions.

### 2.2 Ecosystem and Biodiversity
- **Antarctic Krill**: Small crustaceans that are a key species in the polar marine food web and vital for studying ecosystem health.
- **Biological Sentinel Species**: Organisms used to gauge the ecological health of their environment, particularly in relation to climate change.

### 2.3 Climate and Meteorology
- **Ice Core Sampling**: A method of drilling into ice sheets to extract cylindrical sections of ice, used for historical climate data analysis.
- **Weather Modeling Software**: Tools used to simulate and predict atmospheric conditions based on collected data.

### 2.4 Conservation and Sustainability
- **Sustainable Practices**: Methods and behaviors aimed at reducing environmental impact, including advocating for energy conservation and plastic reduction.
- **Climate Action Advocacy**: Efforts to promote policies and behaviors aimed at combating climate change and protecting ecosystems.

### 2.5 Education and Outreach
- **Public Engagement**: Activities aimed at educating communities about climate science, environmental issues, and Antarctic research.
