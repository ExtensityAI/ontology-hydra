## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Included Areas
- **Geographical Features**: 
  - Antarctic Peninsula
  - Ross Sea
  - Weddell Sea
  - East and West Antarctica
  - Antarctic Islands (e.g., South Georgia, South Shetland Islands)
  
- **Ecological Aspects**: 
  - Antarctic marine biodiversity (e.g., krill, penguins, seals)
  - Terrestrial ecosystems 
  - Ice sheet dynamics

- **Climate Change Factors**: 
  - Global warming impacts on ice melt and sea levels
  - Ocean acidification effects on marine life  
  - Changes in species distribution due to climate variability

- **Human Activities**: 
  - Antarctic tourism and its impacts on the ecosystem
  - Scientific research and its contributions to climate knowledge
  - Fisheries and their management

- **Policy Frameworks**: 
  - Antarctic Treaty System
  - Environmental policies governing human activities
  - Indigenous rights pertaining to Antarctic governance

### 1.2 Explicitly Excluded Areas
- **Non-Antarctic Regions**: 
  - Arctic ecosystems and their dynamics
  - Non-polar marine and terrestrial environments 
  - Climate change impacts in tropical and temperate zones

- **Economic Aspects**: 
  - Commercial exploitation of non-Antarctic resources
  - Trade policies unrelated to Antarctica
  
- **Sociological Studies**:
  - Direct sociological studies on populations outside of the Antarctic community
  
### 1.3 Gray Areas/Overlaps
- **Climate Policy**: 
  - While climate change is included, discussions may overlap with broader global climate initiatives or policies affecting non-polar regions.
  
- **Ecological Research**: 
  - Some ecological studies may involve Arctic contexts or global marine issues, but the focus will remain on Antarctic-specific implications.

- **Tourism and Education**: 
  - Discussions regarding tourism management may overlap with general tourism trends and environmental education practices on a global scale.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Geographical and Environmental Terms
- **Antarctic Peninsula**: A major landmass extending towards South America, notable for its rich biodiversity.
- **Ecosystem Dynamics**: The complex interactions among organisms and their physical environment in Antarctica.
- **Krill**: Small crustaceans critical to the Antarctic food web, serving as a primary food source for many marine species.
- **Ice Shelf**: A floating extension of a glacier, critical in stabilizing Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

### 2.2 Climate Change Terminology
- **Global Warming**: The long-term increase in Earthâ€™s average surface temperature due to human activities, impacting polar regions significantly.
- **Ocean Acidification**: The reduction in pH of ocean waters primarily caused by CO2 absorption, affecting marine life, especially calcifying organisms.
- **Species Distribution**: Refers to how species are spread out in the environment, which is changing in response to climate shifts.

### 2.3 Policy and Governance Terms
- **Antarctic Treaty**: A legally binding agreement established to regulate international relations regarding Antarctica, emphasizing scientific cooperation and environmental protection.
- **Indigenous Rights**: Advocacy for the recognition and inclusion of indigenous populations in climate policy discussions, historically sidelined in environmental governance.

### 2.4 Research and Methodology Terms
- **GIS (Geographic Information Systems)**: Technology used for capturing, analyzing, and managing spatial and geographic data related to environmental research.
- **Fieldwork**: Practical research conducted in the natural environment, critical for gathering data on Antarctic conditions and ecosystems.
- **Ecological Modeling**: Computational simulations used to predict ecological dynamics and responses to environmental changes.
