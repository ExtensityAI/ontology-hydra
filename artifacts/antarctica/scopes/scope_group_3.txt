  - Advocacy for climate change awareness related to the Antarctic.
  - Monitoring of ecosystems and wildlife in the Antarctic region.
  
### 1.2 Excluded from the Domain
- **Non-research Tourism**
  - Activities that do not contribute to scientific knowledge or conservation.
- **Commercial Exploitation**
  - Mining and other commercial activities not aligned with environmental preservation.
- **Activities in Other Polar Regions**
  - Research or events focused solely on the Arctic or other polar areas not specific to Antarctica.

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps with Adjacent Domains
- **Climate Change**
  - Although closely related, climate change itself is a broader global context and may include factors outside of Antarctica.
- **Sustainable Practices**
  - Practices relevant to Antarctic expeditions might overlap with global sustainability initiatives.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Geological Terms
- **Tectonics**: The study of the Earth's structure and the movement of its plates.
- **Glacial Geology**: Branch focusing on the geological impact of glaciers over time.
- **Transantarctic Mountains**: A major mountain range dividing East and West Antarctica, important for geological studies.

### 2.2 Glaciological Terms
- **Ice Sheets**: Large masses of glacial land ice extending over 50,000 square kilometers.
- **Glacier Dynamics**: The study of the movement and behavior of glaciers.
- **Satellite Remote Sensing**: Use of satellite technology to monitor glaciers and ice dynamics.

### 2.3 Meteorological Terms
- **Antarctic Oscillation**: Climate pattern affecting weather variability in the Southern Hemisphere.
- **Katabatic Winds**: Winds flowing down an incline, often occurring in polar regions.
- **Fjords**: Deep, narrow, and elongated sea or lake drains, formed as a result of glacial erosion.

### 2.4 Logistical Terms
- **Supply Chain Management**: Overseeing the entire process of acquiring goods and resources for expeditions.
- **Risk Management**: Strategies and measures taken to mitigate risks associated with operations in extreme environments.
- **Contingency Planning**: Preparing alternative plans to address unexpected challenges during expeditions.

### 2.5 Environmental Terms
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of life found in the Antarctic ecosystem, including flora and fauna.
- **Conservation Efforts**: Measures taken to protect and preserve the Antarctic environment and its species.
