# Scope Document for the Domain of Antarctica

## 1. Domain Boundaries

### 1.1 Inclusion of Topics
- Environmental Studies
  - Antarctic ecosystems and their dynamics
  - Climate change impacts on Antarctic flora and fauna
  - Conservation efforts and wildlife protection
  
- Bird Research
  - Breeding behaviors of Antarctic seabirds, particularly Emperor Penguins
  - Migratory patterns and tracking methods using satellite telemetry

- Oceanography
  - Upwelling and downwelling currents and their effects on marine life
  - Krill populations and their role in the Antarctic food web
  - Interactions between oceanographic phenomena and climate change

- Logistics and Operations
  - Supply chain management for research expeditions in Antarctica
  - Coordination of fieldwork and remote operations

### 1.2 Exclusion of Topics
- Non-scientific tourism activities in Antarctica
- Military operations or geopolitical issues related to territorial claims
- Land-based geology and glaciology unrelated to biological, oceanographic, or ecological research

### 1.3 Gray Areas or Overlaps
- Ecosystem interactions may involve geological processes, yet this document primarily focuses on biological and oceanographic aspects.
- There may be overlaps with global climate change discussions that extend beyond Antarctica, with relevance to ice melting and sea-level rise.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Environmental Studies Terms
- **Ecosystem Dynamics:** Interactions between organisms and their environment in the Antarctic region.
- **Climate Change:** Long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns affecting the Antarctic environment.

### 2.2 Ornithology Terms
- **Seabirds:** Birds that are predominantly associated with marine environments, particularly in the polar regions.
- **Breeding Behaviors:** Reproductive strategies and patterns exhibited by seabirds, including nesting and parental care.

### 2.3 Oceanography Terms
- **Upwelling:** The process by which nutrient-rich waters rise to the surface, supporting marine life.
- **Downwelling:** The process of surface waters sinking, often resulting in reduced nutrient availability for marine organisms.
- **Krill:** Small shrimp-like crustaceans crucial to the Antarctic food web.

### 2.4 Logistics Terms
- **Supply Chain Management:** Coordination of resources and logistics to support research expeditions in extreme environments.
- **Remote Operations:** Management of field activities in inaccessible locations, often requiring specialized planning and resources.

### 2.5 General Terms
- **Open Science:** An approach encouraging the sharing of research data and findings with the public and the wider scientific community.
- **Satellite Telemetry:** A method for tracking the movements of animals through satellite signals.

By establishing this scope document, we aim to enhance communication and understanding across various scientific disciplines concerning Antarctica, providing a foundation for collaborative research endeavors.
