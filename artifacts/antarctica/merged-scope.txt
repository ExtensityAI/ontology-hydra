### 1.2 Explicitly Excluded Areas
- **Non-Antarctic Regions**
  - Arctic ecosystems and dynamics
  - Non-polar marine and terrestrial environments
  - Climate change impacts in tropical and temperate zones

- **Economic and Industrial Exploitation**
  - Commercial exploitation of non-Antarctic resources, including mining and fisheries not aligned with conservation

- **Sociological Studies**
  - Non-scientific cultural aspects unrelated to ecological and environmental science
  - Political relationships not directly related to environmental issues

### 1.3 Gray Areas/Overlaps
- **Climate Policy and Research**
  - While discourse on climate change is included, overlaps may exist with broader global climate initiatives or policies affecting non-polar regions.

- **Tourism Management**
  - Discussions regarding tourism sustainability may overlap with general tourism trends and environmental education practices globally.

- **Interdisciplinary Ecological Research**
  - Studies may involve ecosystems beyond the Antarctic context; however, the focus will remain on Antarctic-specific implications.

## 2. Core Terminology

### 2.1 Geographic and Environmental Terms
- **Antarctic Region**: Southernmost continent characterized by ice, unique ecosystems, and extreme weather conditions.
- **Ecosystem Dynamics**: Interactions among organisms and their environment in Antarctica.
- **Krill**: Small crustaceans fundamental to the Antarctic food web.
- **Ice Core Sampling**: Method for studying past climates by extracting cylindrical sections of ice from glaciers.

### 2.2 Climate Change and Meteorological Terms
- **Global Warming**: Long-term increase in Earthâ€™s average surface temperature impacting the polar regions.
- **Ocean Acidification**: Reduction in pH of ocean waters due to CO2 absorption affecting marine life.
- **Ice Melt**: The process of glaciers and ice caps melting, contributing to rising sea levels.
- **Antarctic Oscillation**: Climate pattern affecting weather variability in the Southern Hemisphere.

### 2.3 Biodiversity and Ecology
- **Biodiversity**: The variety of life in a given habitat or ecosystem.
- **Invasive Species**: Non-native species that adversely affect their new environments.
- **Endemic Species**: Species that are native to and restricted in a specific geographic location.
- **Biological Sentinel Species**: Organisms used to gauge the ecological health of their environment, particularly in response to climate change.

### 2.4 Environmental Policy and Ethics
- **Antarctic Treaty**: An agreement to regulate international relations and protect the Antarctic environment.
- **Environmental Justice**: Fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people concerning environmental decision-making.
- **Climate Action Advocacy**: Efforts to promote policies and behaviors aimed at combating climate change and protecting ecosystems.

### 2.5 Research and Methodology Terms
- **GIS (Geographic Information Systems)**: Technology for capturing and analyzing spatial data related to environmental research.
- **Citizen Science**: Public participation in scientific research, contributing to data collection and analysis.
- **Educational Tours**: Activities designed to inform participants about ecological and environmental issues in Antarctica.

### 2.6 Logistics and Operations Terms
