This is because temperatures above this threshold can damage human skin tissue. Additionally, temperatures above 41℃ can raise the patient's body temperature and may cause side effects such as thermal burns. Therefore, to maintain a safe medical environment, the surface temperature of device attachments should not exceed 41℃. Medical devices that are not intended to heat the patient have a set standard temperature for the surface of their attachments to prevent risks such as skin damage and burns to the patient. This standard temperature is set at 41℃ because it is considered a safe temperature for use on areas of the patient's skin that are exposed. Therefore, it is deemed hazardous if the surface temperature of a medical device attachment exceeds 41℃.",

The coincidence circuit measures the time at which the annihilation radiation is detected by a photomultiplier tube, and simultaneously by another photomultiplier tube, to accurately determine the position of the annihilation radiation. Therefore, the coincidence circuit plays a crucial role in PET imaging. PET imaging detects annihilation radiation resulting from the collision of positrons and electrons to create images. To collect the position information of the annihilation radiation, photomultiplier tubes and scintillators are used. The photomultiplier tube amplifies the photons produced at the location where the annihilation radiation collides, converting them into an electronic signal. This signal is then accelerated by an electromagnetic field and transmitted to the coincidence circuit. The coincidence circuit collects these electronic signals to accurately determine the location of the collision of the annihilation radiation and to create the image. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Coincidence circuit'.",

The ATC is an international classification system for drugs, which does not classify drugs based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action, but rather on the therapeutic use and route of administration of the drugs.

Presenting the chemical characteristics of drugs is one of the main roles of the ATC code, but using mnemonic codes is also a feature of the ATC code.

It is a safe and stable material that allows for accurate measurement of electrical signals between the electrode and the body. Additionally, silver chloride can easily form an oxide layer on the electrode surface, maintaining a stable electrode surface. Biopotential signal measurement electrodes are used to measure electrical signals, and it is important to minimize the contact resistance between the electrode and the skin for accurate measurements. The electrode material must be electrically stable and have minimal impact on skin contact. Ag-AgCl satisfies these conditions. Silver is electrically stable, and silver chloride has minimal impact on skin contact. Moreover, Ag-AgCl has high biocompatibility, making it safe for use within the body. Therefore, Ag-AgCl is one of the most commonly used materials for biopotential signal measurement electrodes.",

The reason why inserting a catheter into a vein is not called an arteriovenous fistula is that an arteriovenous fistula involves a direct connection between an artery and a vein, allowing blood to flow from the artery back to the vein, which is the opposite direction of normal blood flow. Therefore, an arteriovenous fistula does not involve inserting a catheter into a vein to change the direction of blood flow.

The statements that 'The polarization voltage generated from the metal of the electrode should be small,' 'It should maintain stable contact with the body surface for a long time,' and 'Paste is used to reduce the impedance with the skin' are all correct descriptions of bio-surface electrodes. Therefore, the answer is 'Contact resistance is proportional to the area, so the actual contact area with the surface should be reduced.' The reason is that the flow of current is proportional to the contact area between the electrode and the body surface, so the smaller the contact area, the smoother the flow of current.

Thus, brittleness is not a required property for metal materials used in artificial joints. Brittleness is a property that indicates the susceptibility of metal materials to corrosion due to environmental influences, and the metal materials used in artificial hip joints must not be brittle. Therefore, brittleness is not a property that the metal materials used in artificial hip joints should have.

The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a collection of electronic health information that includes a patient's past and present health and medical treatment, as well as relevant facts about their vitality and health status, collected over the long term. Automated Medical Record (AMR) refers to automated medical records, Computerized Medical Record (CMR) to computerized medical records, and Electronic Smart Record (ESR) to electronic intelligent records.

Specific memory refers to the memory capacity of antibodies or cells, which react when they come into contact again with an antigen they have previously encountered. If a specific memory to an implant or biomaterial is formed, a hypersensitive reaction occurs when contact is made again, as the antibodies or cells remember and react. This type of hypersensitivity reaction is known as an allergy. An allergy is a reaction where antibodies are produced due to specific memory to an antigen, and these antibodies bind to the antigen, causing a hypersensitive reaction. Therefore, specific memory to implants or biomaterials can lead to the production of antibodies and an allergic reaction. A defense response is a non-specific reaction to an antigen, a rejection response is a reaction to transplanted tissues or organs, and an autoimmunity response is an immune reaction against one's own tissues or cells.",

This term is used to classify brainwave frequency bands, and it corresponds to brainwave frequencies between 8 ~ 13 Hz. Alpha waves are generally considered a mid-range frequency band of brainwaves and are observed when the brain is in a relaxed and stable state. Alpha waves are brainwave patterns with a frequency range of 8~13Hz that are most active when a person is in an emotionally stable state. They are typically observed during meditation or rest, and because the frequency of the brainwaves is slow and the amplitude is large, they indicate a stable state.

It plays an important role in regulating the internal environment of the cell. Since the cell membrane in a resting state is more permeable to K+ ions, the Na+/K+ pump functions to expel Na+ ions out and bring K+ ions in, maintaining the ion concentration difference inside and outside of the cell. The statement 'Osmosis moves ions.' is not a mechanism that regulates the resting membrane potential. Reason: The resting membrane potential is maintained by moving ions to preserve the ion concentration difference across the cell membrane. Osmosis, which is the movement of water from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration, plays a crucial role in maintaining this concentration difference. Therefore, the statement 'Osmosis moves ions.' is actually a incorrect because it is not moving the ions.",

By calculating the ratio of calcium (Ca) atoms to phosphorus (P) atoms in this compound, we get Ca/P = 10/6 = 1.67. Therefore, the correct answer is \"1.67\". The atomic weight ratio of calcium to phosphorus is 40.08 g/mol and 30.97 g/mol, respectively, which would suggest a molar ratio of 1.3:1. However, the molecular formula of hydroxyapatite also includes hydrogen, so when calculating the molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus, hydrogen must also be considered. In the molecular formula of hydroxyapatite, there are 2 × 6 = 12 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus to hydrogen is 10:6:12, which simplifies to 5:3:6. Simplifying this further gives a ratio of 1.67:1. Therefore, the correct answer is \"1.67\".",

Diffusion is the movement of particles due to a concentration gradient, while convection is the movement of particles due to a pressure gradient. Therefore, 'Diffusion, Convection' is the correct answer. Ultrafiltration, which filters particles based on size, is not included as a method of solute removal. The methods of solute removal in hemodialysis primarily involve diffusion and convection. Diffusion is the natural movement of particles due to a concentration gradient, and it utilizes the concentration difference between blood and dialysate to remove solutes. Convection is the movement of particles along with the flow of liquid, and it removes solutes by causing blood to flow through the dialysate. Therefore, among the listed options for methods of solute removal in hemodialysis, diffusion and convection are included, and the correct answer is 'Diffusion, Convection'.",
