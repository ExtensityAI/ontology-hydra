What should be the maximum surface temperature of a device attachment that is not intended to heat the patient?	43℃	36℃	38℃	41℃	The surface temperature of a device attachment that is not intended to heat the patient should not exceed 41℃. This is because temperatures above this threshold can damage human skin tissue. Additionally, temperatures above 41℃ can raise the patient's body temperature and may cause side effects such as thermal burns. Therefore, to maintain a safe medical environment, the surface temperature of device attachments should not exceed 41℃.	Medical devices that are not intended to heat the patient have a set standard temperature for the surface of their attachments to prevent risks such as skin damage and burns to the patient. This standard temperature is set at 41℃ because it is considered a safe temperature for use on areas of the patient's skin that are exposed. Therefore, it is deemed hazardous if the surface temperature of a medical device attachment exceeds 41℃.	D
What is the band of electromagnetic waves used in a thermographic camera?	X-ray	Microwave	Ultraviolet	Infrared	The electromagnetic waves used in thermographic cameras must be in a safe band that does not have harmful effects on the human body. Therefore, 'X-rays' and 'Microwaves' have too high energy and can be harmful to the human body, and 'Ultraviolet' can have harmful effects on the human body in some bands, so it is not used. On the other hand, 'Infrared' is in a safe band that does not have harmful effects on the human body, and is used in thermographic cameras.	The band of electromagnetic waves used in thermographic cameras is infrared. It is used to detect the heat emitted from the human body because the wavelength of the infrared matches the wavelength of the heat emitted by the body. X-rays and microwaves can be harmful to the human body, and ultraviolet has less impact on the body but is not suitable for measuring body temperature. Therefore, infrared is used in thermographic cameras.	D
Which of the following is not a suitable material for the membrane oxygenator in an artificial heart-lung machine?	Ceramic membrane	Teflon membrane	Silicon rubber membrane	Polypropylene membrane	The materials used for the membrane oxygenator in an artificial heart-lung machine include Silicon rubber membrane, Polypropylene membrane, and Teflon membrane, but Ceramic membrane is not used. Ceramic membrane is a material used in other fields and is not used in artificial heart-lung machines.	In artificial heart-lung machines, membrane oxygenators are used to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. The appropriate materials for this application should allow the passage of oxygen and carbon dioxide while also being durable and resistant to deformation over time. Therefore, 'Ceramic membrane' is not an appropriate material because ceramics, although durable, lack flexibility and are more prone to deformation. Hence, 'Silicon rubber membrane', 'Polypropylene membrane', and 'Teflon membrane' are more suitable materials for use in artificial heart-lung machines.	A

Therefore, it is used to diagnose the condition of bones.	A bone densitometer measures the calcium concentration in bones to determine the density and strength of the bones. Through this, bone diseases such as osteoporosis can be diagnosed and prevented. Therefore, its purpose and measurement methods differ from other devices like X-rays or ultrasound.	A
Which of the following is NOT a typical method for processing analog biological signals?	Demodulation	Synthesis	Modulation	Amplification	The concept of 'Synthesis' does not exist as a typical method for processing analog biological signals.	Typical methods for processing analog biological signals include amplification, modulation, and demodulation. However, 'Synthesis' is not a typical method. Synthesis means combining multiple signals into one signal. But biological signals represent individual biological characteristics, so it is not possible to combine them with other signals to create a synthesized signal. Therefore, 'Synthesis' is the correct answer.	B

Therefore, the correct order of the heart's wall layers is 'Epicardium-Myocardium-Endocardium'.	The correct answer is 'Epicardium-Myocardium-Endocardium'. The wall of the heart is structured in three layers, and the role of each layer is as follows: 1. Epicardium: This is the outermost layer that surrounds the heart, protecting it and anchoring it in place. 2. Myocardium: This middle layer is composed of muscle fibers, which are the main components of the heart, and it is responsible for pumping blood by contracting and relaxing. 3. Endocardium: This is the innermost layer that lines the inside of the heart, protecting the heart and lubricating the interior to facilitate the heart's movements.	D
Which of the following biomaterials has the lowest modulus of elasticity?	Aluminium	Zirconium	Stainless steel	Synovial fluid	Synovial fluid is a fluid, therefore it has the lowest modulus of elasticity. Stainless steel, aluminium, and zirconium are all solids, so they have higher moduli of elasticity.	Synovial fluid is a fluid found within the human body that lubricates joints and absorbs shocks. To perform these functions, it must have a low modulus of elasticity. Synovial fluid has a high viscosity and a low modulus of elasticity, making it an ideal biomaterial. Therefore, synovial fluid has the lowest modulus of elasticity among the biomaterials listed.	D

Which of the following is not a property of biomedical ceramic materials?	Biocompatible.	Easy to mold and process.	High compressive strength.	Wear resistance and corrosion resistance.	The characteristic that is least associated with biomedical ceramic materials is 'Easy to mold and process.' This is because ceramic materials are processed at high temperatures, making them difficult to mold and process. Additionally, ceramic materials are known for their strong wear and corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and high compressive strength.	Answer: 'Easy to mold and process.' Explanation: Biomedical ceramic materials are used inside the human body, where biocompatibility is one of the most important factors. Therefore, it is typical for biomedical ceramic materials to exhibit excellent biocompatibility. On the other hand, 'Easy to mold and process.' is a characteristic that is generally not associated with ceramic materials. Ceramics are typically difficult to process and mold.	B
What type of test conditions are implemented when evaluating biocompatibility using cells or tissues?	Clinical test	Animal test	In vitro test	In vivo test	Biocompatibility evaluation using cells or tissues is classified as an In vitro test. This is conducted outside of a living body and aims to simulate the response within the body. Therefore, it is distinct from Animal tests or Clinical tests.	Evaluating biocompatibility by culturing cell proliferation or biological tissues corresponds to an In vitro test. Since the test is conducted outside of a living organism, it has the ethical advantage over Animal tests or In vivo tests when assessing biocompatibility.	C

Therefore, a temperature control device is not a component of an extracorporeal shock wave lithotripter.	C
Which part of the brain is responsible for sensory information related to balance, movement, and muscle tone, and corresponds to the homeostatic regulator that maintains normal body temperature?	Midbrain	Cerebrum	Cerebellum	Diencephalon	The cerebellum is responsible for sensory information related to the body's balance, movement, and muscle tone, but it is not the homeostatic regulator that maintains normal body temperature. The hypothalamus, part of the diencephalon, primarily performs this function.	The cerebellum plays an important role in motor control, balance, and coordination, but it is not directly involved in the regulation of body temperature. The hypothalamus, which is a part of the diencephalon, is the key brain structure for homeostasis and is responsible for regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, and other autonomic functions.	C
Which of the following descriptions about the gamma camera is incorrect?	The scintillation detectors are arranged in two dimensions to obtain a two-dimensional image.	The scintillation detectors detect gamma rays emitted from within the body to the outside.	No mechanical scanning action is required to obtain the image.	The scintillation crystal converts gamma rays into infrared rays.	The statement that the scintillation crystal converts gamma rays into infrared rays is incorrect. The scintillation detectors detect gamma rays emitted from within the body to the outside and use this to obtain a two-dimensional image. Mechanical scanning action is required for this.	The statement that the scintillation crystal converts gamma rays into infrared rays is incorrect. A gamma camera consists of scintillation detectors and scintillation crystals. The scintillation detectors are used to detect gamma rays and obtain images of the inside of the body, while the scintillation crystals convert gamma rays into visible light, not infrared rays.	D
To classify medical procedures using a combination code that arranges the actions, instruments, purposes, and parts of the therapeutic process in order, how many total codes are needed if there are 10 types of actions, 10 types of instruments, 10 types of purposes, and 20 types of parts?	10,000 types	50 types	20,000 types	10,020 types	The total number of codes is the product of the number of each element. Therefore, 10 x 10 x 10 x 20 = 20,000, so the correct answer is '20,000 types'.	The total number of codes is 20,000, which is the result of 10 x 10 x 10 x 20. This is because each element can be combined independently.	C
Which gas is used for freezing purposes such as preserving umbilical cord blood?	Carbon dioxide	Oxygen	Hydrogen	Nitrogen	Nitrogen is the safest and most stable gas used for freezing purposes, which is why it is widely used in medical fields such as preserving umbilical cord blood. Additionally, nitrogen makes up the largest proportion of air, making it relatively inexpensive to obtain.	Nitrogen has excellent freezing properties and high safety, making it widely used in the medical field for freezing purposes. It is particularly used for preserving umbilical cord blood because nitrogen minimizes tissue damage during freezing while enabling uniform freezing.

What is the correct sequence of inflammatory response around the damaged wound tissue caused by the insertion of biomaterials?	Capillary dilation → Cell infiltration → Extraction → Disintegration → Epithelialization	Capillary dilation → Cell infiltration → Regeneration → Epithelialization → Disintegration	Capillary dilation → Cell infiltration → Epithelialization → Regeneration → Disintegration	Capillary dilation → Cell infiltration → Disintegration → Extraction → Epithelialization	The correct answer is 'Capillary dilation → Cell infiltration → Regeneration → Epithelialization → Disintegration'. When tissue damage occurs due to the insertion of biomaterials, capillaries dilate and an inflammatory response occurs. Then, cells infiltrate and tissue regeneration takes place, followed by the formation of epithelialization. Finally, disintegration occurs and the tissue recovers. Therefore, the sequence progresses as capillary dilation → cell infiltration → regeneration → epithelialization → disintegration.	The correct answer is 'Capillary dilation → Cell infiltration → Regeneration → Epithelialization → Disintegration'. When biomaterials are inserted into wound tissue, capillary dilation initiates the inflammatory response. Subsequently, cells infiltrate to regenerate the wound tissue, and then epithelialization is formed. Finally, the inflammatory response dissipates, completing the healing process.	B
Which of the following is not a function or purpose of an upper limb orthosis?	To support body weight	To protect weak muscles	To protect painful areas or prevent deformities	To maintain a constant angle of the joints	To support body weight is not a primary purpose of an upper limb orthosis, unlike the other options, because it is related to the general structure of the body. Upper limb orthoses are primarily designed to protect weak muscles, maintain a constant joint angle, and protect painful areas or prevent and correct deformities.	The functions and purposes of an upper limb orthosis include protecting weak muscles, maintaining a constant joint angle to protect painful areas, or to prevent deformities. However, 'To support body weight' is not related to the purpose of an upper limb orthosis. Upper limb orthoses are mainly used by people with muscle or joint function issues, and supporting body weight is the domain of other types of orthoses or equipment.	A
Which of the following is NOT a function of the kidneys?	Synthesis and breakdown of glycogen	Regulation of body fluids and electrolytes	Blood pressure regulation	Maintenance of acid-base balance	The kidneys do not have the function of synthesizing and breaking down glycogen. This function is carried out by the liver. The kidneys are responsible for regulating blood pressure, maintaining acid-base balance, and controlling body fluids and electrolytes.	The kidneys do not possess the function of synthesizing and breaking down glycogen; this is the role of the liver. The kidneys remove waste from the blood, regulate the concentration of body fluids and electrolytes, control blood pressure, and maintain acid-base balance.	A
Which of the following cannot be tested using spectrophotometry?	Serum test	Component test	Hormone test	Red/white blood cell test	Spectrophotometry is used to measure the amount of components in the blood, and serum tests and hormone tests can be conducted using this method. However, red and white blood cells are not components in the blood but blood cells, so they cannot be tested using spectrophotometry. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Red/white blood cell test'.	Spectrophotometry is a method that uses the wavelength of light to analyze the components of a substance. Therefore, 'Component test' which examines the components within the blood, 'Serum test' which measures the amount of components in the blood, and 'Hormone test' which examines hormones in the blood can all be conducted using spectrophotometry. However, 'Red/white blood cell test' is not about measuring the amount of components but rather measuring the number and shape of red and white blood cells in the blood, which cannot be tested using spectrophotometry.	D

What is related to the resting potential?	K+ ion	H2O	Da+ ion	O2	The resting potential refers to the electrical difference across the cell membrane of nerve cells or muscle cells. This electrical difference is primarily maintained by the movement of ions. K+ ions are relatively abundant inside the cell membrane and can pass through the cell membrane via ion channels. Therefore, the movement of K+ ions plays an important role in maintaining the resting potential.	The resting potential signifies the electrical difference between the inside and the outside of a neuron. This electrical difference is primarily maintained by the movement of ions. K+ ions have a high concentration inside the neuron and can exit to the outside through ion channels. The movement of these K+ ions plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting potential. Hence, K+ ions are related to the resting potential.	A
Which component of a PET scanner is used to collect the position information of annihilation radiation?	Coincidence circuit	Scintillator	Collimator	Photomultiplier tube	In PET imaging, the detection of annihilation radiation, which occurs due to the interaction between positrons and electrons, is essential for image creation. A device that collects the position information of the annihilation radiation is required for this purpose. This device is the coincidence circuit. The coincidence circuit measures the time at which the annihilation radiation is detected by a photomultiplier tube, and simultaneously by another photomultiplier tube, to accurately determine the position of the annihilation radiation. Therefore, the coincidence circuit plays a crucial role in PET imaging.	PET imaging detects annihilation radiation resulting from the collision of positrons and electrons to create images. To collect the position information of the annihilation radiation, photomultiplier tubes and scintillators are used. The photomultiplier tube amplifies the photons produced at the location where the annihilation radiation collides, converting them into an electronic signal. This signal is then accelerated by an electromagnetic field and transmitted to the coincidence circuit. The coincidence circuit collects these electronic signals to accurately determine the location of the collision of the annihilation radiation and to create the image. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Coincidence circuit'.	A
Which of the following is NOT a measurement parameter of patient monitoring devices?	Blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate	Respiratory rate, body temperature	Electrocardiogram, blood oxygen saturation	Body temperature, electromyography	The correct answer is 'Body temperature, electromyography'. The reason is that patient monitoring devices are primarily used to monitor cardiac and respiratory functions. Therefore, body temperature and electromyography are not typically monitored.	Body temperature and electromyography are not measurement parameters of patient monitoring devices. These devices mainly measure parameters such as electrocardiograms, blood oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. Body temperature is generally measured using a thermometer, and electromyography is used to measure muscle activity.	D

Which of the following is not an interaction between the human body and diagnostic radiation?	Compton scattering	Pair production	Ionization	Mass defect	Mass defect is a phenomenon that occurs within atomic nuclei, where a neutron is produced through the combination of an electron and a positron during nuclear reactions. This is not an interaction with radiation and is not directly related to the properties of radiation. Therefore, mass defect does not pertain to the interaction between the human body and radiation.	The term 'mass defect' refers to the phenomenon where the mass inside an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of the electrons and neutrons. It occurs during nuclear fission and fusion, which are the causes of radioactivity. Interactions between the human body and diagnostic radiation include ionization, pair production, and Compton scattering, which involve the energy of radiation interacting with human tissue and causing biological effects.

Which test belongs to dynamic testing method that measures the mechanical properties of biomaterials caused by repetitive loading?	Compression test	Tensile test	Hardness test	Fatigue test	The fatigue test is a method for measuring how durable a biomaterial is under repetitive loading. This test plays a crucial role in predicting the durability of biomaterials under the repetitive loads they will experience during actual use. Therefore, the fatigue test is one of the very important testing methods for evaluating the practical usability of biomaterials.	While static tests measure the deformation of a material under a fixed load, dynamic tests measure the fatigue properties of a material under repetitive loading. Therefore, the 'fatigue test' belongs to dynamic testing that measures the mechanical properties caused by repetitive loading. This test is important for evaluating the fatigue characteristics of a material and predicting the material's lifespan and safety.	D
What is the first phenomenon that occurs when a medical device made of biomaterials enters the bloodstream?	Formation of fibrin network	Protein denaturation and adsorption	Attachment of red blood cells to the foreign surface	Attachment of white blood cells to the material surface	The first phenomenon that occurs when a medical device made of biomaterials enters the bloodstream is protein denaturation and adsorption. This refers to the interaction and subsequent transformation or adsorption of proteins on the surface of the medical device with proteins in the blood. This is an important factor that affects the safety and efficacy of the medical device.	When a medical device made of biomaterials enters the bloodstream, the first phenomenon that occurs is protein denaturation and adsorption. This phenomenon involves the adsorption and transformation of blood proteins on the surface of the medical device, which promotes interaction between the medical device and the blood, and affects the safety and efficacy of the medical device. This phenomenon is one of the important factors that must be considered during the design and development of medical devices.	B
Which of the following is not related to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system?	It has a hierarchical structure, allowing for logical grouping.	Combination products cannot be included.	It uses mnemonic codes.	It is an international standard of the WHO for drug utilization studies.	The correct answer is 'Combination products cannot be included.' The ATC is an international classification system for drugs, which does not classify drugs based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action, but rather on the therapeutic use and route of administration of the drugs. Therefore, saying that it uses mnemonic codes means that the ATC code classifies drugs based on their therapeutic use and route of administration.	Presenting the chemical characteristics of drugs is one of the main roles of the ATC code, but using mnemonic codes is also a feature of the ATC code. Mnemonic codes are used to assign codes based on the name or ingredients of the drug, and are used in the ATC code system. Hence, the correct answer is 'Combination products cannot be included.'	C
Which device does not use a catheter?	Fetal stethoscope	Invasive blood pressure monitor	Thermodilution cardiac output monitor	Intracranial pressure monitor	The fetal stethoscope is a medical device that allows one to listen to the fetal heart sounds without the use of a catheter. The other options involve devices that use a catheter to measure blood pressure or cardiac function.	A fetal stethoscope is a device used to listen to the heart sounds of a fetus and does not use a catheter. The other options listed are devices that require the insertion of a catheter into the blood vessels to measure blood pressure or cardiac function, making the fetal stethoscope the correct answer as it does not use a catheter.	A
Which medical device measures body composition such as water, protein, and fat by flowing a constant alternating current through the body and measuring impedance?	Hemodialysis machine	Electrosurgical unit	Electromyograph	Body composition analyzer	A body composition analyzer is a medical device that measures the impedance in the body by flowing a constant alternating current to determine the body's water, protein, and fat content. Therefore, it has the function of analyzing the components of the body, which is different from the functions of an electromyograph, hemodialysis machine, or electrosurgical unit.	The function of flowing a constant alternating current through the body and measuring impedance to analyze components such as water, protein, and fat content is specific to a body composition analyzer. The other options involve devices with different functions: an electromyograph measures muscle activity, a hemodialysis machine purifies blood, and an electrosurgical unit is used in surgical procedures to cut tissue and control bleeding.	D
Which of the following is NOT commonly measured by a patient monitoring device?	Electrocardiogram (ECG)	Body temperature	Blood pressure	Electromyography (EMG)	Patient monitoring devices commonly measure signals such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure, and body temperature. Electromyography, which is used to measure muscle activity, is not commonly used in patient monitoring devices.	While physiological signals measured by patient monitoring devices, such as white blood cell count, blood oxygen saturation, and respiration, are all related to the functions of the body, electromyography measures muscle activity and is not directly related to the physiological functions of the body. Therefore, electromyography is not considered a physiological signal.	D
Which action of laser medical devices causes disruption of cell membranes, evaporation of water from cells, swelling, and cell rupture?	Blood coagulation action	Thermal action	Electrical action	Photonic action	When electromagnetic waves are absorbed by body tissue cells, the energy of the electromagnetic waves causes the molecules inside the tissue cells to vibrate, generating heat. This thermal action raises the temperature of the tissue cells, causing dysfunction or destruction. Therefore, the most important effect of electromagnetic waves on the body is the thermal action.	Laser medical devices generate high-energy light beams that deliver heat to the tissue interior. This causes the molecules inside the tissue to vibrate, and this vibration generates heat. This thermal action leads to the destruction of cell membranes, evaporation of water from cells, expansion, and cell rupture. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Thermal action'.	B
What is the type of a material such as alumina that does not cause any chemical reaction in the body after being implanted into biological tissue?	Biocompatible synthetic material	Bioactive material	Bioabsorbable material	Bioinert material	Bioinert materials are those that do not react or react very little after being implanted into biological tissues, and new fibrous tissue may form on the surface of the material. This is because the material remains stable within the body and does not interact with biological tissues. Therefore, bioinert materials are suitable for use inside the human body and can be used for organ transplants such as artificial organs or artificial hearts.	Bioinert materials are materials that do not cause chemical reactions within the body and remain unchanged after implantation into biological tissues. Such materials are commonly used in artificial joints, dental prostheses, etc., and ceramic materials like alumina are typical examples. These materials are stable within the body and elicit minimal biological response, making them suitable for use in organ transplants. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Bioinert material'.	D
Which of the following is NOT an imaging variable in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)?	Spin-spin relaxation time (T2)	Hydrogen density	Spin-lattice relaxation time (T1)	Electron density	The correct answer is 'Electron density'. MRI uses the magnetic resonance of hydrogen atoms to create images, and electron density is not a variable related to hydrogen atoms. The imaging variables used in MRI are hydrogen density, spin-lattice relaxation time (T1), and spin-spin relaxation time (T2).	Electron density is not a variable used in MRI imaging. MRI generates images using the magnetic resonance of hydrogen atoms, and since electron density is not related to hydrogen atoms, it is not a variable in MRI. Hydrogen density is related to the brightness in the image, and T1 and T2 are related to the contrast of the image.	D
What is the typical material used for metal electrodes in biopotential signal measurement?	Lead (Pb)	Copper (Cu)	Ag-AgCl	Aluminum (Al)	Biopotential signal measurement electrodes are in contact with the human body, so a safe and stable electrode material is required. Ag-AgCl is commonly used for this purpose. It is a safe and stable material that allows for accurate measurement of electrical signals between the electrode and the body. Additionally, silver chloride can easily form an oxide layer on the electrode surface, maintaining a stable electrode surface.	Biopotential signal measurement electrodes are used to measure electrical signals, and it is important to minimize the contact resistance between the electrode and the skin for accurate measurements. The electrode material must be electrically stable and have minimal impact on skin contact. Ag-AgCl satisfies these conditions. Silver is electrically stable, and silver chloride has minimal impact on skin contact. Moreover, Ag-AgCl has high biocompatibility, making it safe for use within the body. Therefore, Ag-AgCl is one of the most commonly used materials for biopotential signal measurement electrodes.	C
Which of the following structures is not part of the hindbrain?	pons	hypothalamus	cerebellum	vermis	The hypothalamus is connected to the pituitary gland and regulates the secretion of hormones, as well as body temperature, water balance, and appetite, so it does not belong to the hindbrain.	The hypothalamus is located in the central part of the brain and plays a role in regulating biological activities such as hormone secretion, body temperature regulation, and water balance. Therefore, the hypothalamus, which is located between the midbrain and the thalamus, does not belong to the hindbrain and is the correct answer.	B
Which of the following statements about hemodialysis is incorrect?	In hemodialysis, solute removal is achieved through diffusion and convection, while fluid removal is achieved through ultrafiltration.	Complications of hemodialysis can include hypotension, muscle cramps, and dialysis disequilibrium syndrome.	A dialysis solution that interacts with blood to remove waste and excess fluid while replenishing and maintaining necessary electrolytes is required, and its concentration is similar to that of plasma.	Inserting a catheter into a vein for vascular access is called an arteriovenous fistula.	The statement that inserting a catheter into a vein for vascular access is called an arteriovenous fistula is incorrect. An arteriovenous fistula is actually created by directly connecting an artery to a vein, not by inserting a catheter into a vein.	The statement that solute removal in hemodialysis is achieved through diffusion and convection, and fluid removal is achieved through ultrafiltration is correct. The reason why inserting a catheter into a vein is not called an arteriovenous fistula is that an arteriovenous fistula involves a direct connection between an artery and a vein, allowing blood to flow from the artery back to the vein, which is the opposite direction of normal blood flow. Therefore, an arteriovenous fistula does not involve inserting a catheter into a vein to change the direction of blood flow. Complications of hemodialysis can include hypotension, muscle cramps, and dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. A dialysis solution that interacts with blood to remove waste and excess fluid while replenishing and maintaining necessary electrolytes is required, and its concentration is similar to that of plasma. Fluid removal is achieved through ultrafiltration, and solute removal is achieved through diffusion and convection.	D
Which of the following is NOT a clinical impact of PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System)?	Real-time interpretation, improved clinical efficiency through automation, decentralization of radiology services	Standards are unnecessary for the exchange of imaging information	Facilitates collaborative research through data sharing	Ease of use of imaging data for educational purposes	The statement that standards are unnecessary for the exchange of imaging information is incorrect. PACS requires standardized formats for exchanging and storing imaging information, which is why a standardized exchange method is necessary. For this purpose, there is an international standard called DICOM.	The option stating that standards are unnecessary for the exchange of imaging information is incorrect. PACS supports the storage and exchange of imaging data generated from medical imaging equipment of various manufacturers in a standardized format. For this, it uses an international standard protocol called DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). Therefore, the use of PACS necessitates standardization for the exchange of imaging information, which enables efficient management and sharing of imaging data.	B
Which combination of factors affecting the degree of heat transfer from biological tissues is incorrect?	Tissue density, blood density, blood flow	Tissue density, tissue specific heat, convection	Blood flow, blood density, blood specific heat	Tissue density, tissue specific heat, blood flow	The answer is 'Tissue density, tissue specific heat, convection'. Tissue density and specific heat are indeed factors that affect the degree of heat transfer in tissues, but convection is related to the flow of blood. Therefore, the combination 'Tissue density, tissue specific heat, convection' is incorrect in the context of factors affecting heat transfer from biological tissues.	Convection is not a combination of factors that affects the degree of heat transfer from biological tissues. Convection refers to the flow of fluids or air and is related to heat transfer, but it is not a direct factor affecting heat transfer. The answer is 'Tissue density, tissue specific heat, convection'. Tissue density and specific heat are important factors that influence heat transfer. Higher tissue density slows down the rate of heat transfer, and higher tissue specific heat increases the amount of heat transferred. In contrast, convection, which indicates the degree of flow of fluids or air, does not directly affect heat transfer.	B
Which of the following statements about the heart is incorrect?	Among the walls of the left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle, the wall of the left ventricle is the thickest.	The plateau phase in the cardiac muscle action potential curve is due to the action of Fe.	The action potential of the cardiac muscle lasts longer than that of the skeletal muscle.	Arrhythmia refers to an abnormality in the heart's excitation process or its conduction process, leading to an irregular heart rhythm.	The statement that the plateau phase in the cardiac muscle action potential curve is due to the action of Fe is incorrect. The plateau is a phenomenon where the potential of the cardiac muscle is maintained at a certain level, and this is due to the action of Ca2+. The influx of Ca2+ into the cardiac muscle cells creates the plateau phase.	The statement that the plateau phase in the cardiac muscle action potential curve is due to the action of Fe is incorrect. The plateau refers to the phase where the potential of the cardiac muscle is maintained at a certain level, and this is due to the action of Ca2+. The influx of Ca2+ into the cardiac muscle cells creates the plateau phase, and subsequently, the action of K+ causes the potential to decline again.	B
Which law is related to the measurement of oxygen saturation?	Imbert-Fick's law	Beer's law on the emission of light	Beer's law on the absorption of light	Kegel exercise	The correct answer is 'Beer's law on the absorption of light'. This law explains the absorption phenomenon that occurs inside a material when light passes through it, stating that the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the material and its properties. Therefore, in the measurement of oxygen saturation, this law is applied to calculate the oxygen concentration by measuring how much light is absorbed by oxygen.	The measurement of oxygen saturation is a method that determines the oxygen concentration by measuring the amount of light absorbed as the light passes through a sample. Beer's law on the absorption of light states that the concentration of a substance within a sample is proportional to the amount of light absorbed. Therefore, as the oxygen concentration increases, the amount of light absorbed also increases, making this law applicable to the measurement of oxygen saturation.	C
Which of the following is commonly known as Teflon and primarily used for making artificial blood vessels?	PP (Polypropylene)	PE (Polyethylene)	Polyester	PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene)	PTFE is non-stick and has excellent heat resistance, corrosion resistance, and durability, making it suitable for the production of artificial blood vessels. It is also commonly used because its biocompatibility has been verified for safe use within the human body.	Teflon is a trade name for PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), which has very high heat resistance and chemical resistance, making it suitable for the production of medical devices such as artificial blood vessels. The other options do not possess these characteristics.	D
Which of the following is NOT a problem that can arise from the use of artificial joints?	Deep wound site infection	Wear of the artificial joint surface	Increased bone density	Dislocation after surgery	Increased bone density is not directly related to the use of artificial joints. An increase in bone density generally occurs in conditions such as osteoporosis and is unrelated to the use of artificial joints. Therefore, among the given options, the one that is NOT a problem that can arise from the use of artificial joints is 'Increased bone density'.	Problems that can arise from the use of artificial joints include dislocation after surgery, deep wound site infection, and wear of the artificial joint surface. However, increased bone density is not directly related to the use of artificial joints. Increased bone density generally occurs due to factors such as lack of exercise, nutritional deficiencies, and hormonal changes, which are unrelated to the use of artificial joints.	C
What effect is used to measure the velocity of blood flow by measuring the frequency change of the ultrasound reflected back from the blood cells?	Doppler effect	Photoelectric effect	Electric field effect	Hall effect	When ultrasound is transmitted into the blood vessels, the frequency of the ultrasound reflected back from the blood cells changes. This changed frequency is measured to determine the velocity of blood flow, and this phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect.	As ultrasound passes through the blood vessels, the frequency of the ultrasound that is reflected off the blood cells changes depending on the velocity of the blood flow. This phenomenon is referred to as the Doppler effect. Therefore, when measuring the velocity of blood flow using an ultrasound imaging device, the Doppler effect is utilized. The other options are different physical phenomena that are not related to ultrasound.	A
Which of the following statements about bio-surface electrodes is incorrect?	Contact resistance is proportional to the area, so the actual contact area with the surface should be reduced.	Paste is used to reduce the impedance with the skin.	The polarization voltage generated from the metal of the electrode should be small.	It should maintain stable contact with the body surface for a long time.	The statement that contact resistance is proportional to the area, so the actual contact area with the surface should be reduced, means that to lower the contact resistance of a bio-surface electrode, it should contact the body surface with as small an area as possible. That is, the larger the area of the electrode, the higher the contact resistance, so contacting with a smaller area can reduce the contact resistance.	The statements that 'The polarization voltage generated from the metal of the electrode should be small,' 'It should maintain stable contact with the body surface for a long time,' and 'Paste is used to reduce the impedance with the skin' are all correct descriptions of bio-surface electrodes. Therefore, the answer is 'Contact resistance is proportional to the area, so the actual contact area with the surface should be reduced.' The reason is that the flow of current is proportional to the contact area between the electrode and the body surface, so the smaller the contact area, the smoother the flow of current. Thus, maintaining as small a contact area as possible is important for bio-surface electrodes.	A
Which of the following is NOT a goal of medical informatics as proposed by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA)?	Increasing the efficiency of medical records	Learning computer operation methods	Computer-assisted learning	Information retrieval and management	Increasing the efficiency of medical records is not a goal but a method, therefore it is not included in the goals proposed by AMIA. The goals of AMIA are to effectively manage and retrieve medical information to aid in patient care.	Increasing the efficiency of medical records is not directly mentioned among the goals proposed by AMIA. The goals of medical informatics typically focus on the efficient management and utilization of medical information, providing information necessary for medical decisions, and improving patient safety and quality of care. However, increasing the efficiency of medical records is an important element for the efficient management and utilization of medical information. Medical records are a crucial source of medical information, and through efficient recording and management methods, the quality and safety of medical information can be enhanced. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of medical records is closely related to the goals of medical informatics.	A
Which of the following is NOT a basic function of an incubator?	Ventilation control	Humidity control	Temperature control	Freezing control	An incubator is a device that controls temperature, humidity, and ventilation to aid the growth and development of living organisms, but it does not require a freezing function. In fact, if it had a freezing function, it could negatively affect the growth and development of the organisms. Therefore, 'freezing control' is not a basic function of an incubator.	An incubator is a piece of equipment that provides a controlled environment of consistent temperature, humidity, and ventilation to assist the growth and development of living organisms. However, since incubators do not have a freezing function, 'freezing control' is not one of their basic functions. The primary function of an incubator is to maintain a constant temperature, humidity, and ventilation to support the growth and development of living organisms.	D
Which of the following is NOT correct definition of electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms?	The T wave represents repolarization of the atria	The P wave represents depolarization of the atria	The R wave represents depolarization of the ventricles	The Q wave represents depolarization of the interventricular septum	The answer is 'The T wave represents repolarization of the atria'. The T wave actually represents the repolarization of the ventricles, not the atria, and occurs after the contraction of the ventricles is complete. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the T wave represents the repolarization of the atria.	The T wave does not represent the repolarization of the atria but rather the repolarization of the ventricles. The T wave indicates the electrical repolarization of the ventricles, the Q wave represents the depolarization of the interventricular septum, the R wave represents the depolarization of the ventricles, and the P wave represents the depolarization of the atria.	A
Which of the following is NOT a required property for the metal materials used in artificial hip joints?	Wear resistance	Mechanical strength	Brittleness	Corrosion resistance	Brittleness is not a required property for metal materials used in artificial joints. Brittleness refers to the tendency of a metal to corrode when oxidized in the presence of air. Since artificial joints are located inside the human body, they must not corrode, therefore materials with low brittleness are used. Thus, brittleness is not a required property for metal materials used in artificial joints.	Brittleness is a property that indicates the susceptibility of metal materials to corrosion due to environmental influences, and the metal materials used in artificial hip joints must not be brittle. Therefore, brittleness is not a property that the metal materials used in artificial hip joints should have. On the other hand, corrosion resistance, mechanical strength, and wear resistance are essential properties that the metal materials used in artificial hip joints must possess.	C
What is the CT number of water?	-1000	0	2000	1000	The CT number of water is 0. The CT number represents the X-ray attenuation value of a material, and since water almost completely transmits X-rays, its CT number is close to 0.	The CT number for water is 0. This is because, compared to other materials, water has the lowest density when it comes to the passage of X-rays. The CT number is determined by the density of the material and the rate of absorption when X-rays pass through it. Since water has a low density and does not absorb X-rays well, its CT number is 0.	B
Which of the following is NOT a type of mechanical strength test for medical devices?	Rough impact test	Drop test	Leakage current test	Push test	The leakage current test is not related to mechanical strength testing but is used to evaluate the electrical safety of medical devices. Therefore, it is not a type of mechanical strength test.	The leakage current test is unrelated to mechanical strength testing and is used to verify electrical safety. Hence, in this list, only options related to mechanical strength testing should be included, making 'Leakage current test' the answer. 'Push test', 'Drop test', and 'Rough impact test' are all types of mechanical strength tests.	C
Which of the following descriptions about the thermal effects of high-frequency electromagnetic fields on biological tissues is incorrect?	Stimulation of cells occurs frequently, and a decrease in temperature due to thermal action occurs.	At an intensity of 5 mW/cm2, it can affect the testes and cause infertility.	The absorption of heat is indicated by the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR).	At an intensity of 150 mW/cm2, it can affect the eyes and cause cataracts.	The statement that stimulation of cells occurs frequently, and a decrease in temperature due to thermal action occurs is incorrect. High-frequency electromagnetic fields cause movement of ions within cells, which stimulates the cells, but this is a phenomenon separate from thermal action. Therefore, while stimulation of cells does occur frequently, a decrease in temperature does not occur.	The statement that at an intensity of 150 mW/cm2, it can affect the eyes and cause cataracts is incorrect. The thermal effects of high-frequency electromagnetic fields on biological tissues are determined by the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), and the higher the SAR, the stronger the thermal effect. Therefore, while high-frequency electromagnetic fields can stimulate cells, they can also cause a decrease in temperature due to thermal action.	A
Which of the following is a correct description of an analog signal?	A biological signal with discrete variations like voice	A physical quantity that changes discretely depending on current and time	A physical quantity in which voltage and current change continuously depending on time	A physical quantity that changes discretely depending on voltage and time	An analog signal is a physical quantity in which voltage and current change continuously depending on time. It has a continuous wave form and, unlike digital signals, does not have discrete variations.	The statement that a physical quantity in which voltage and current change continuously depending on time is correct. This is a characteristic of analog signals, not digital signals. Digital signals are physical quantities that change discretely depending on voltage and time. They are represented by binary numbers, such as 0 and 1, and are distinct from biological signals with discrete variations.	C
What is the most important part of the HIS that digitizes the series of processes centered around patient visits?	EMR	LIS	CDS	OCS	OCS stands for Order Communication System, which is a system that digitizes and manages information such as tests, prescriptions, and appointments necessary for patient care by medical staff such as doctors and nurses when patients visit the hospital. Therefore, it is one of the core parts of HIS and plays an essential role in the patient care process.	OCS stands for Order Communication System, which is a system that digitizes and manages information such as tests, prescriptions, and appointments necessary for patient care by medical staff such as doctors and nurses when patients visit the hospital. As the most central part of HIS, it digitizes the series of processes centered around patients visiting the hospital, enabling efficient medical care.	D
Which of the following descriptions about the specificity of biological phenomena is incorrect?	Biological signals are weak and generally have a low signal-to-noise ratio.	There are few transient phenomena, and reproducibility is excellent.	There is a large variation among individuals, but homeostasis is maintained within an individual.	It is difficult to extract a specific signal for a certain part of the body in a pure form.	The statement that there are few transient phenomena, and reproducibility is excellent is incorrect. Biological phenomena are highly transient and have low reproducibility. This is because biological phenomena are very complex and influenced by various factors. Therefore, very sophisticated experimental design and analysis techniques are required when studying biological phenomena.	The incorrect description about the specificity of biological phenomena is 'There are few transient phenomena, and reproducibility is excellent.' In fact, biological phenomena often involve many transient events, and reproducibility can be poor. This is because biological phenomena are influenced by various factors. Therefore, when analyzing biological signals, these factors must be taken into account.	B
What is the term for the electronic health information that is collected over the long term, including a patient's past and present health and medical treatment, as well as relevant facts about their vitality and health status?	Electronic Health Record (EHR)	Automated Medical Record (AMR)	Computerized Medical Record (CMR)	Electronic Smart Record (ESR)	The correct answer is 'Electronic Health Record (EHR)'. EHR refers to the concept of electronically recording and storing a patient's health information, which includes past and present health information, medical treatment history, medication prescriptions, and more. While AMR, CMR, and ESR are all electronic medical record systems, EHR is distinguished by its comprehensive recording and management of health information.	The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a collection of electronic health information that includes a patient's past and present health and medical treatment, as well as relevant facts about their vitality and health status, collected over the long term. Automated Medical Record (AMR) refers to automated medical records, Computerized Medical Record (CMR) to computerized medical records, and Electronic Smart Record (ESR) to electronic intelligent records. However, unlike EHR, these systems do not comprehensively record and manage a patient's health information.	A
What type of hypersensitivity, a pathological antigen-antibody reaction, is caused by specific memory to implants or biomaterials?	Allergy	Defense response	Rejection response	Autoimmunity response	Correct answer: Allergy. Specific memory refers to the memory capacity of antibodies or cells, which react when they come into contact again with an antigen they have previously encountered. If a specific memory to an implant or biomaterial is formed, a hypersensitive reaction occurs when contact is made again, as the antibodies or cells remember and react. This type of hypersensitivity reaction is known as an allergy.	An allergy is a reaction where antibodies are produced due to specific memory to an antigen, and these antibodies bind to the antigen, causing a hypersensitive reaction. Therefore, specific memory to implants or biomaterials can lead to the production of antibodies and an allergic reaction. A defense response is a non-specific reaction to an antigen, a rejection response is a reaction to transplanted tissues or organs, and an autoimmunity response is an immune reaction against one's own tissues or cells.	A
Which of the following is an initial evaluation test for the biological safety of a medical device?	Carcinogenicity test	Chronic toxicity test	Implantation test	Biodegradability test	The implantation test is used to evaluate the biological safety of medical devices. It is a test that assesses the biological safety when a medical device is implanted into human tissue. The implantation test plays an important role in the evaluation of the biological safety of medical devices because it assesses the biological safety of the parts that come into contact with human tissue.	The implantation test is one of the tests to evaluate the biocompatibility of medical devices, checking the reactions that occur when in contact with human tissue. Through the implantation test, it is assessed whether a medical device can be safely used within the human body. Therefore, the implantation test is one of the initial evaluation tests for assessing the biological safety of medical devices.	C
Which factor does not significantly affect the signal when measuring an electrocardiogram (ECG)?	Changes in temperature and humidity of the examination room	Baseline fluctuation due to breathing	Interference caused by power line frequency (60Hz)	Noise introduced by muscle movement	Changes in the temperature and humidity of the examination room do not significantly affect the ECG signal. This is because these changes do not directly influence the ECG signal. On the other hand, factors such as muscle movement, power line frequency, and breathing do affect the ECG signal.	Since an electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart, changes in the temperature and humidity of the examination room do not affect the heart's electrical activity. Therefore, they are not factors that significantly affect the ECG signal. In contrast, muscle movement, breathing, and power line frequency are factors that do influence the ECG signal.	A
What is the phenomenon where substances move in only one direction due to the selective permeability of the cell membrane?	Osmosis	Active transport	Diffusion	Solvent drag	The cell membrane has selective permeability to allow certain substances to pass through. Due to this characteristic, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, and the phenomenon where they move in only one direction is called osmosis. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Osmosis'.	The cell membrane has selective permeability to allow only certain substances to pass through. Due to this characteristic, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, which is called osmosis. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Osmosis'. Solvent drag refers to the movement of substances due to molecular motion within a solution, while diffusion is the random movement of molecules due to a concentration difference. Active transport is the movement of substances through specific proteins in the cell membrane.	A
Which of the following is NOT a component of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine?	Oxygenator	Filter	Blood pump	Arteriovenous fistula	The components of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine include an oxygenator, a filter, and a blood pump. An arteriovenous fistula is not related to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine; it is a vascular anomaly where the arterial wall weakens, allowing blood to leak outside the arterial wall. Therefore, an arteriovenous fistula is not a component of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine.	A cardiopulmonary bypass machine is composed of an oxygenator to oxygenate the blood, a filter to filter the blood, and a blood pump to circulate the blood. However, an arteriovenous fistula is not a component of this machine. An arteriovenous fistula refers to a situation where blood leaks from an artery due to a rupture in the arterial wall, and it is not directly related to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.	D
What is the device that helps to restore function, directly or indirectly heal, or prevent deterioration in areas where the human body has structural defects or lost/reduced function through artificial apparatus or devices?	Artificial joint	Stent	Prosthesis	Orthosis	An orthosis is a device that assists areas of the body with structural defects or lost/reduced function to restore function or to help with direct or indirect healing. Therefore, among the given options, 'Orthosis' is the correct answer. 'Prosthesis' refers to overcoming something with willpower, 'Artificial joint' is an artificial device that replaces a joint, and 'Stent' is a device inserted into a blood vessel to prevent its closure.	An orthosis is a device that helps to restore function, directly or indirectly heal, or prevent deterioration in areas where the human body has structural defects or lost/reduced function through artificial apparatus or devices. It assists the body's functions to minimize discomfort in daily life and to restore function. For example, a walking aid helps patients who have lost leg function to walk, and a hearing aid helps people with hearing impairments to hear sounds.	D
Which of the following radiation therapy devices is not an external beam therapy device?	Van de Graaff	Linac	Gamma knife units	Cyclotron	Gamma knife units are not external beam therapy devices but are stereotactic radiosurgery devices.	Gamma knife units are not external beam therapy devices but are stereotactic radiosurgery devices, which are used to deliver radiation precisely to brain tumors and other targets within the brain. Therefore, they are distinct from external beam therapy devices that deliver radiation from outside the body.	C
Which of the following is NOT a component of an anesthesia machine system?	Ventilator	Vaporizer	Condenser	Flowmeter	The anesthesia machine system performs functions such as anesthetic delivery, ventilation, control, and monitoring, but the condenser is not included in these functions. A condenser removes moisture from the air to maintain dry air, so it is not directly related to the anesthesia machine system.	An anesthesia machine system consists of components for the supply, control, and exhaust of anesthetics. The vaporizer evaporates the anesthetic for delivery, the ventilator ventilates the anesthetic for exhaust, and the flowmeter adjusts the supply of the anesthetic. However, a condenser does not convert the anesthetic into a liquid state for exhaust. Therefore, a condenser is not a component of the anesthesia machine system.	C
Which mode of ventilation in mechanical ventilators delivers air in synchrony with the patient's ventilatory effort?	Controlled ventilation	Pressure support ventilation	Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation	Intermittent mandatory ventilation	Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a mode of mechanical ventilation that delivers air in synchrony with the patient's ventilatory effort. This mode supplies air in response to the patient's breathing, which helps maintain the naturalness of breathing. Additionally, it performs intermittent mandatory ventilation to expand and relax the patient's lungs.	Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a mode that delivers air in synchrony with the patient's ventilatory effort, where the ventilator detects the patient's breaths and supplies air in conjunction with those breaths. This mode maintains the naturalness of breathing by supplying air in response to the patient's breaths and respects the patient's ventilatory effort as much as possible.	C
Which respiratory function test assesses the ability of the lungs to distribute air evenly between alveoli?	Ventilation capacity	Distribution capacity	Exposure capacity	Diffusion capacity	Distribution capacity evaluates the function of the even distribution of air among the alveoli within the lungs. The other options are terms used to assess different functions of the respiratory system.	Distribution capacity evaluates the function of the even distribution of air among the alveoli within the lungs. This is one of the important indicators for assessing lung function and plays a crucial role in maintaining the efficient functioning of the lungs. The other options include ventilation capacity, which is the function of inhaling and exhaling air in the lungs; diffusion capacity, which is the function of exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs; and exposure capacity, which assesses functions related to the lung's volume.	B
In which case must a radiation worker receive radiation exposure dose measurement at least once a month?	When using elution media	When using radiation shielding facilities	When using film badges	When working at a radiation measurement agency	Film badges have the characteristic of turning black when exposed to radiation, which allows for a simple measurement of radiation exposure dose. Therefore, radiation workers often use film badges to measure their radiation exposure dose.	Film badges have the characteristic of turning black when exposed to radiation, allowing for the measurement of radiation exposure dose. Therefore, in cases where radiation workers need to receive a radiation exposure dose measurement at least once a month, they use film badges for this measurement.	C
What is the performance metric represented by the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) in CT?	Linearity	Noise performance	Spatial resolution	Contrast	Spatial resolution is a measure of how small an area can be detected in a CT image. It is related to the resolution of the image, and the higher the resolution, the more finely small areas can be distinguished. Therefore, the higher the spatial resolution in a CT image, the more accurate the diagnosis can be.	In CT, the MTF is a performance indicator of spatial resolution. MTF is a function that shows how well the system responds to the input spatial frequencies, and spatial resolution refers to the smallest object size that the system can differentiate. Therefore, a higher MTF in CT means a higher spatial resolution, indicating that smaller objects can be distinguished more clearly.	C
Which of the following is a common nonpolarizing electrode used in medical and biological experiments?	Stainless steel needle electrode	Gold electrode	Silver electrode	Silver-silver chloride electrode	The silver-silver chloride electrode is made of silver and silver chloride, and is widely used as a non-polarizable electrode. This electrode is highly stable and has rapid electrochemical reactions, which is why it is widely used in the medical and biological experimental fields.	The silver-silver chloride electrode has high stability and electrically stable characteristics, and can be safely used within the body, which is why it is commonly used for medical and biological experiments. Additionally, the large surface area of the electrode increases the accuracy of measurements, which is another advantage.	D
Which tissue has the highest resistivity at a frequency of 100[Hz]?	Bone marrow	Fat	Liver	Blood	Fat has the lowest conductivity compared to other biological tissues. This is because fat has almost no ability to conduct electricity. Therefore, the response to electrical stimuli can be very weak or nonexistent.	As the frequency decreases, the electrical resistance increases, and fatty tissue has high electrical resistance, showing the highest resistivity at low frequencies. Therefore, at a frequency of 100[Hz], the tissue with the highest resistivity is 'Fat'.	B
Which type of electrode is designed in the form of a thin plate or membrane to increase contact with the curved surfaces of the body and to reduce the effects of movement by being easily bendable?	Flexible electrode	Adsorption electrode	Microelectrode	Redox electrode	The flexible electrode is designed in the form of a thin plate or membrane to increase contact with the curved surfaces of the body and to reduce the effects of movement by being easily bendable. Therefore, it is suitably used on the curved surfaces inside the body.	The flexible electrode is designed to increase contact with the curved surfaces of the body and to reduce the effects of movement by being easily bendable in the form of a thin plate or membrane. The other options have different characteristics. The adsorption electrode uses molecules attached to the surface to transfer charge, the microelectrode refers to an electrode of small size, and the redox electrode uses chemical reactions to transfer charge.	A
What is the name of the brainwave with a frequency range of 8 to 13 Hz?	Theta wave	Alpha wave	Delta wave	Gamma wave	The name of the brainwave component with a frequency band of 8 ~ 13 Hz is 'Alpha wave'. This term is used to classify brainwave frequency bands, and it corresponds to brainwave frequencies between 8 ~ 13 Hz. Alpha waves are generally considered a mid-range frequency band of brainwaves and are observed when the brain is in a relaxed and stable state.	Alpha waves are brainwave patterns with a frequency range of 8~13Hz that are most active when a person is in an emotionally stable state. They are typically observed during meditation or rest, and because the frequency of the brainwaves is slow and the amplitude is large, they indicate a stable state. Therefore, in the state where alpha waves are most active, there can be positive effects such as increased concentration and creativity.	B
Which medical suture material is used for absorbable surgical sutures?	PGA	PP	Teflon	Silicon	PGA stands for Polyglycolic Acid, which is a biodegradable polymer material used for sutures that are absorbed after surgery. Due to this characteristic, it eliminates the need for a follow-up surgery and shortens the treatment period. Teflon, PP, and Silicon are all medical suture materials, but they have different properties from PGA.	The polymer material used for absorbable surgical sutures is PGA (Polyglycolic Acid). It is one of the biodegradable polymers that is metabolized into harmless substances within the body. Therefore, the suture naturally degrades and is removed after surgery, which makes it safe to use. PET, TEELON, and SILICONE are not used for surgical sutures.	A
Which statement is not true about spectrophotometers used in clinical laboratories and how they work?	Clinical substances selectively absorb or emit light energy.	Reagents are added to serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, etc., for testing.	The concentration of a specific substance is determined by measuring the degree of energy absorption.	X-rays are used as the light source.	The statement that X-rays are used as the light source is incorrect. Spectrophotometers use light to measure the absorption or emission of substances, and X-rays are not light but electromagnetic waves. X-rays are used in other equipment such as X-ray machines.	The statement that X-rays are used as the light source is incorrect because X-rays are electromagnetic waves, but the term 'light' refers to electromagnetic waves such as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light. Therefore, in clinical testing equipment, light sources such as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light are used for analysis, not X-rays.	D
Which of the following is not a bioelectrical signal?	Electrocardiogram (ECG)	Electrooculogram (EOG)	Electroencephalogram (EEG)	Phonocardiogram (PCG)	Phonocardiogram (PCG) records the sounds of the heart, which are not directly related to bioelectrical phenomena, and therefore cannot be recorded through electrodes. Hence, the answer is 'Phonocardiogram (PCG)'.	Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), and Electrooculogram (EOG) all correspond to bioelectrical signals, whereas Phonocardiogram (PCG) measures the sounds of the heart and is not related to bioelectrical signals.	D
What is the method called that uses sensors to measure biological tissues separated from the body?	External measurement	Surface measurement	Invasive measurement	Sample measurement	The method of measuring biological tissues with sensors is called 'sample measurement' because it involves taking a sample of the biological tissue for measurement.	Biological tissues that are separated from the body cannot be measured externally, so they are measured by taking them as samples. Therefore, this method is classified as 'sample measurement'.	D
Which layer of the skin is located on the outermost part, composed of a protein called Keratin, has the highest resistance in the equivalent circuit between the electrode and the skin surface, and is removed during electrode attachment for measurement?	Dermis	Granular layer	Stratum corneum	Basal layer	The stratum corneum is located on the outermost part of the skin and is composed of keratin, which gives it the highest resistance in the equivalent circuit between the electrode and the skin surface. Therefore, it is removed during electrode attachment for measurement. The dermis, basal layer, and granular layer are terms that represent other components of the skin and have different roles than the stratum corneum.	The stratum corneum is located on the outermost part of the skin and is composed of a protein called keratin, which gives it the highest resistance in the equivalent circuit between the electrode and the skin surface. Therefore, it is possible to remove it during electrode attachment for measurement. In contrast, the dermis, basal layer, and granular layer are located at different depths of the skin and have less electrical resistance compared to the stratum corneum.	C
Which metal material is used as an electrode material in pacemakers because of its excellent corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity?	Ag	Pt	W	Au	Pt (platinum) is widely used for electrodes in pacemakers and other medical devices implanted in the body due to its excellent corrosion resistance and good electrical conductivity. Additionally, platinum is biocompatible, making it suitable for use in medical devices within the human body.	The electrodes of a pacemaker are responsible for detecting and transmitting the heart's signals. These electrodes must not corrode and must be able to conduct electricity effectively. Therefore, a metal material with excellent corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity is required. Among these materials, Pt (platinum) is widely used as the electrode material for pacemakers due to its outstanding corrosion resistance and excellent electrical conductivity.	B
Which part of the brain contains the respiratory center that regulates breathing?	Cerebrum	Cerebellum	Spinal cord	Medulla oblongata	The correct answer is 'medulla oblongata'. The medulla oblongata is part of the brain's nervous system, which regulates the heart, blood vessels, respiratory system, etc. It plays an essential role in maintaining the body's basic survival functions.	The respiratory center that controls breathing is located in the medulla oblongata. The medulla oblongata is the connection between the spinal cord and the brainstem and is part of the central nervous system that regulates functions necessary for life support, such as respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. Therefore, the medulla oblongata, where the central nervous system that controls breathing is located, is the correct answer.	D
Which of the following is NOT a mechanism that regulates the resting membrane potential?	Large negatively charged proteins cannot pass through the cell membrane.	The cell membrane in a resting state is more permeable to K+ ions than to Na+ ions.	Osmosis moves ions.	The Na+/K+ pump expels 3 Na+ ions out of the cell and brings 2 K+ ions in.	The answer is 'Osmosis moves ions.' Osmosis refers to the natural movement of water across a cell membrane due to a concentration gradient. It plays an important role in regulating the internal environment of the cell. Since the cell membrane in a resting state is more permeable to K+ ions, the Na+/K+ pump functions to expel Na+ ions out and bring K+ ions in, maintaining the ion concentration difference inside and outside of the cell.	The statement 'Osmosis moves ions.' is not a mechanism that regulates the resting membrane potential. Reason: The resting membrane potential is maintained by moving ions to preserve the ion concentration difference across the cell membrane. Osmosis, which is the movement of water from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration, plays a crucial role in maintaining this concentration difference. Therefore, the statement 'Osmosis moves ions.' is actually a incorrect because it is not moving the ions.	C
Which of the following is an example of ionizing radiation?	Visible light	Ultraviolet	Microwaves	Gamma rays	Gamma rays are a type of ionizing radiation that can remove electrons and cause ionization. Therefore, gamma rays are the correct answer. Microwaves, visible light, and ultraviolet are not ionizing radiation, so they do not apply.	Gamma rays are one type of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is emitted from atomic nuclei and has the highest energy among electromagnetic waves, which is part of the process to maintain the stability of atomic nuclei. Gamma rays have the highest energy among these types of ionizing radiation, characterized by very short wavelengths and high frequencies. Therefore, gamma rays are a very dangerous form of radiation that can cause significant harm to the human body.	D
Which of the following is not a preventive method for physically protecting files to reduce the possibility of data damage?	File backup	Disaster prevention facilities	Access control to the transcription room	Data encryption	Data encryption is a technical method unrelated to physical file protection. Even if files are exposed, they can be protected in an encrypted state, so it does not fall under physical preventive measures. Encryption is a method of protecting the contents of files by encrypting them so that outsiders cannot access and read the information.	Data encryption is a method of protecting the data itself, not physical file protection, and is a preventive measure to safely protect data from attacks by hackers or malware. Therefore, it is not a preventive measure for physically protecting files to reduce the possibility of data damage.	D

At which stage of gait analysis does the tibia become perpendicular to the ground from maximum knee flexion?	Initial swing phase	Mid-swing phase	Loading response phase	Mid-stance phase	During the gait analysis, the time when the tibia becomes perpendicular to the ground from maximum knee flexion is during the mid-swing phase. This occurs immediately after the sole of the foot touches the ground, known to happen during the mid-swing phase. At this time, the load is evenly distributed between the foot and the ground, and then the action of lifting the sole off the ground occurs during the mid-stance phase.	The time when the tibia becomes perpendicular to the ground from maximum knee flexion is during the mid-swing phase. This represents the most stable state of knee movement, and the mid-swing phase plays a role in maintaining the stability of knee movement. Therefore, it is important to understand the position and condition of the mid-swing phase when analyzing knee movement or diagnosing diseases such as arthritis.	B
Which device uses a new frequency waveform generated by the difference between two high frequencies that cross each other with almost no skin resistance?	Interferential therapy device	Low-frequency therapy device	Laser therapy device	High-frequency therapy device	An interferential therapy device creates a new frequency by crossing two high frequencies.

What is the thin cytoplasmic protrusion attached to a neuron that, along with the cell body and axon, constitutes the neural unit of a neuron?	schwann cell	white matter	myelin sheath	dendrite	Dendrites are components that, along with the neuron cell body, receive neural stimuli. They are thin cytoplasmic protrusions that constitute the neural unit of a neuron. The other options, such as myelin sheath, white matter, and Schwann cells, are related to other parts of the neuron and are not directly related to dendrites.	Dendrites are the most important parts of a neuron for receiving synaptic signals, along with the neuron cell body. The other options are related to neurons but do not serve the same function as dendrites. The myelin sheath surrounds the axon of a neuron and is a structure that allows for fast and efficient nerve transmission. White matter is one of the components of a neuron, maintaining the overall structure of the neuron and playing a role in transmitting nerve signals. Schwann cells are involved in the formation of the myelin sheath and play a role in protecting the axon of the neuron.	D

Which of the following is NOT a criterion for determining the potential risk in the classification of medical devices?	The duration of contact with the human body	Whether there is a chemical change in the oral cavity	The degree of invasiveness	Whether the device delivers drugs or energy to the patient	The presence of a chemical change in the oral cavity is not an appropriate criterion for determining the potential risk in the classification of medical devices. This is because it is not common for medical devices to induce chemical changes within the oral cavity. Therefore, more appropriate criteria for the classification of medical devices include the degree of invasiveness, the duration of contact with the human body, and whether the device delivers drugs or energy to the patient.	The presence of a chemical change in the oral cavity is an irrelevant factor for determining the potential risk in the classification of medical devices. The classification of medical devices is determined based on factors such as whether the device is inserted into the body, the duration of insertion or implantation within the body, and whether the device delivers drugs or energy to the patient. The presence of a chemical change in the oral cavity is related to the functionality of the medical device and pertains to the performance evaluation of the device. Therefore, 'whether there is a chemical change in the oral cavity' is not an appropriate criterion for determining the potential risk in the classification of medical devices.	B
Which unit of radiation is used to determine how much radiation has been absorbed?	Sv (Sievert)	Gy (Gray)	C/kg	R (Roentgen)	Gy (Gray) is the unit that represents the energy of absorbed radiation. Another radiation unit, Rad, only indicates the amount of absorbed radiation, which makes accurate measurement difficult because the absorption effect varies depending on the type and energy of the radiation. Therefore, Gy (Gray) takes into account both the amount and energy of absorbed radiation, allowing for more accurate measurement.	The unit used to indicate the extent to which radiation has been absorbed is Gy (Gray). It represents the amount of absorbed energy. C/kg is a unit for the charge quantity of radiation, R indicates the electrical ionization of radiation in air, and Sv is a unit that represents the biological effect of radiation on the human body. Therefore, when you want to know the extent to which radiation has been absorbed, Gy (Gray) is used.	B
Which of the following is the correct definition of cardiac output?	The volume of blood pumped by the heart into the aorta per heartbeat	The volume of blood pumped by the heart into the aorta per hour	The volume of blood pumped by the heart into the aorta per minute	The volume of blood pumped by the heart into the aorta per day	Cardiac output refers to the volume of blood that the heart pumps into the aorta per minute. Therefore, the correct answer is 'The volume of blood pumped by the heart into the aorta per minute.'	The correct answer is 'The volume of blood pumped by the heart into the aorta per minute.' This is an indicator of the amount of blood the heart pumps out in one minute, and typically, a cardiac output of 4 to 8 liters per minute is maintained for normal heart function.	C
Which of the following imaging devices requires a cyclotron?	SPECT	PET	X-ray CT	MRI	PET, which stands for Positron Emission Tomography, uses radioactive isotopes to measure metabolic processes occurring within the body. After injecting the radioactive isotope, a cyclotron is used to produce high-energy electrons to generate the radioactive isotopes, which are then used to measure the metabolic processes. Therefore, the imaging device that requires a cyclotron is PET.	PET, short for Positron Emission Tomography, uses positron emitters to create images. A cyclotron is necessary to produce these positron emitters. Hence, the imaging device that requires a cyclotron is PET. MRI, SPECT, and X-ray CT, which stand for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, and X-ray Computed Tomography respectively, do not use positron emitters and therefore do not require a cyclotron.	B
Which of the following types of radiation does not belong to particle radiation?	Electron beam	Positron beam	Gamma rays	Neutron beam	Gamma rays are not considered particle radiation because, unlike electrons, positrons, or neutrons, they manifest as electromagnetic waves rather than particles.	Gamma rays do not qualify as particle radiation because they are a form of electromagnetic radiation, not particles. The other options listed consist of particles, and therefore, they are considered particle radiation.	C
During the cardiac cycle, when does the ventricular pressure increase sharply while all valves are closed, maintaining a constant ventricular volume?	Rapid ejection phase	Isovolumetric contraction phase	Reduced ejection phase	Atrial contraction phase	The isovolumetric contraction phase is the stage of the cardiac cycle where the ventricles contract and push blood into the body. During this phase, the ventricular pressure increases sharply, but since the atria have previously contracted and supplied blood to the ventricles, the ventricular volume remains constant. Therefore, during this period, all valves are closed, preventing blood from flowing back and ensuring it flows into the body.	During the cardiac cycle, the ventricular pressure increases sharply due to ventricular contraction, but since all valves are closed at this time, the ventricular volume remains constant. This period is known as the isovolumetric contraction phase. This phenomenon occurs as the ventricular walls contract sharply while pushing blood out, and during this time, the heart valves are closed, preventing blood from returning to the heart and instead flowing into the arteries. Therefore, the isovolumetric contraction phase refers to the period during the cardiac cycle when blood flows into the arteries.	B
What is equivalent to the single-limb-support phase in gait?	Swing phase of the same limb	Swing phase of the opposite limb	Double-limb-support phase of the same limb	Double-limb-support phase of the opposite limb	In gait, the single-limb support phase refers to the time when one foot is in contact with the ground providing support. Therefore, the swing phase of the opposite limb, which is the time when the other foot is not in contact with the ground, coincides with the single-limb support phase of the supporting foot, making it the correct answer.	The single-limb-support phase in gait refers to the period when only one foot is in contact with the ground. Therefore, the swing phase of the opposite limb is the period during which the other foot is not yet in contact with the ground, which is equivalent to the single-limb-support phase. Hence, the correct answer is 'Swing phase of the opposite limb'.	B
Which biological tissue has the highest viscosity?	Blood	Bone	Soft tissue	Water	Bone has a very high viscosity because it is a solid, with very strong intermolecular interactions and restricted molecular movement.	Bone is one of the hardest and strongest structures among biological tissues, which is why it has the highest viscosity. It supports and protects the human body, and is connected to muscles to control movement. Therefore, bone has a higher viscosity than water, blood, and soft tissue.	B
Which type of orthosis is NOT categorized based on the impact on human joints?	Supportive orthosis	Protective orthosis	Enhancement orthosis	Corrective orthosis	Among the types of orthoses categorized by their impact on human joints, there is no such thing as an 'enhancement orthosis'. A 'protective orthosis' serves to protect the joint and increase stability, a 'supportive orthosis' assists muscle strength to aid movement, and a 'corrective orthosis' corrects abnormal joint movements and maintains proper posture.	There is no 'enhancement orthosis' among the types of orthoses categorized by their impact on human joints. While other orthoses focus on protection, assistance, and correction of human joints, an 'enhancement orthosis' would imply an orthosis that improves the function of human joints. For example, orthoses for strengthening muscles or improving athletic performance would fall under the category of enhancement orthoses.	C
Which of the following is not an item used for blood pressure or pulse measurement?	Mercury sphygmomanometer	Blood pressure monitor	Fundus sphygmomanometer	Pulse meter	Although the mercury sphygmomanometer is an item among blood pressure measurement devices, its use has been banned due to safety issues, and it is no longer produced or sold. Therefore, other blood pressure measurement devices are now used instead.	Among devices of different grades, the reason why the 'mercury sphygmomanometer' is of a different grade is that it uses mercury to measure blood pressure, and mercury is classified as a hazardous substance. Therefore, the mercury sphygmomanometer is subject to stricter regulations and management compared to other devices due to its higher risk.	A
Which coil is additionally used in an MRI system to improve the field uniformity of the main magnet (superconducting electromagnet)?	RF coil	Shimming coil	Gradient coil	Choke coil	The shimming coil is used in magnetic resonance imaging systems to improve the uniformity of the magnetic field of the main magnet. This coil is installed around the main magnet to adjust the uniformity of the magnetic field, correcting any inhomogeneities in the magnetic field to enhance the quality of the image.	To increase the uniformity of the magnetic field of the main magnet, it is necessary to create a region with a uniform magnetic field. For this purpose, the shimming coil is used. The shimming coil is installed around the main magnet and complements the magnet's magnetic field to create a uniform magnetic field. This allows the MRI system to achieve high resolution and accuracy.	B

The Goldmann tonometer is one of the most widely used methods for measuring intraocular pressure. This tonometer measures the force required to flatten the cornea until its diameter becomes 3.06mm after the examiner has injected a fluorescent liquid into the cornea. This method allows for accurate measurement of intraocular pressure and is a safe and non-invasive method. Therefore, the correct answer is the Goldmann tonometer.	D
Which ultrasound imaging technique shows a cross-sectional view of the inside of the human body?	B-mode	TM-mode	A-mode	M-mode	B-mode uses ultrasound to show a cross-sectional view of the inside of the body. This method involves scanning the inside of the body with ultrasound and displaying the scanned results on a monitor to check the internal structure. A-mode is a method that uses ultrasound to measure distance, M-mode shows changes in the ultrasound echo signals over time, and TM-mode measures the elasticity of tissue.	In B-mode, the ultrasound waves travel straight towards the target and the signals that are reflected back are received vertically to create a cross-sectional image. Therefore, B-mode is the ultrasound imaging technique that shows a cross-sectional image. A-mode displays a single ultrasound signal over time, M-mode displays the ultrasound signal according to time and depth, and TM-mode is a combination of M-mode and B-mode.	A
Which of the following is a function of the skeleton?	Digestive function	Excretory function	Vocal function	Hematopoietic function	The skeleton is composed of bones and muscles, and bones have the hematopoietic function of generating blood cells. Therefore, the hematopoietic function is the most appropriate as a function of the skeleton.	The skeleton, consisting of bones and muscles, has a hematopoietic function. This function plays an important role in preventing and treating blood disorders such as anemia. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, maintaining and producing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. Therefore, the skeleton plays a crucial role in maintaining our body's blood health through its hematopoietic function.	D
What is the classification of medical device parts that can be attached to the body, where the patient leakage current is 0.01mA under normal conditions and less than 0.05mA under a single fault condition?	Type C part	Type B part	Type BF part	Type CF part	A patient leakage current of less than 0.01mA requires a part with a protection level of Type C or higher, and a current of less than 0.05mA under a single fault condition requires a protection level of Type F or higher. Therefore, the Type CF part, which satisfies both the protection level of Type C and higher and Type F and higher, is the correct answer.	The medical device part where the patient leakage current is 0.01mA under normal conditions and less than 0.05mA under a single fault condition is a Type CF part. The Type CF part is designed to ensure the highest level of electrical safety, providing greater electrical protection than Type B, Type BF, and Type C parts. Therefore, it is safe to use Type CF parts in medical devices that can be attached to the body with electrodes.	D
What is the ratio of calcium to phosphorus (Ca/P) in hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2], a component of bone?	1.67	0.50	1.33	1.50	"The chemical formula for hydroxyapatite, a component of bone, is Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. By calculating the ratio of calcium (Ca) atoms to phosphorus (P) atoms in this compound, we get Ca/P = 10/6 = 1.67. Therefore, the correct answer is ""1.67""."	"The atomic weight ratio of calcium to phosphorus is 40.08 g/mol and 30.97 g/mol, respectively, which would suggest a molar ratio of 1.3:1. However, the molecular formula of hydroxyapatite also includes hydrogen, so when calculating the molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus, hydrogen must also be considered. In the molecular formula of hydroxyapatite, there are 2 × 6 = 12 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus to hydrogen is 10:6:12, which simplifies to 5:3:6. Simplifying this further gives a ratio of 1.67:1. Therefore, the correct answer is ""1.67""."	A
What has the highest CT Number?	Air	Bone (cortical)	Nylon	Metallic prosthesis	The CT Number is a value used in computed tomography (CT) scans that is assigned based on tissue density. Therefore, metallic materials such as prostheses have a high density, which results in the highest CT Number. Thus, 'Metallic prosthesis' is the correct answer.	The CT Number represents a value related to the density of a material when it is penetrated by X-rays. Metallic prostheses have a higher density compared to the other options, which means they have the highest CT Number. In other words, when X-rays pass through, metallic prostheses absorb more X-rays than the other options, resulting in a higher CT Number.	D
Which medical device assists heart function to increase cardiac output with a mechanical device to prevent the problem of reduced oxygen supply to the brain due to decreased blood flow to the brain when blood pressure drops?	IABP (Intra Aortic Balloon Pump)	PET (Positron Emission Tomography)	Linac (Linear accelerator)	MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)	The IABP is a mechanical device that inflates a small balloon inside the artery in sync with the heart's systole to maintain blood pressure, thereby maintaining the blood flow to the brain. Therefore, it can prevent the problem of reduced oxygen supply to the brain by assisting the heart function in a state of failure. Linac, MRI, and PET are all medical devices, but they do not have the function to maintain blood pressure.	The IABP (Intra Aortic Balloon Pump) is a medical device that assists heart function to prevent the problem of reduced oxygen supply to the brain due to decreased blood flow to the brain when blood pressure drops as a result of decreased function. This device inflates a small balloon inside the aorta to increase blood pressure during heart contraction and decrease it during relaxation, thereby increasing the heart's cardiac output.	A
Which passive biological tissue mechanically connects bones to bones?	ligament	scaffold	cartilage	tendon	Ligaments connect bones to bones. They stabilize joints and limit their movements, which is a different function from tendons or cartilage, and distinct from scaffolds.	Ligaments are passive biological tissues that connect bones to bones, providing mechanical support and stability. They differ from tendons, which connect muscles to bones, and from cartilage, which does not directly connect bones to bones. Scaffolds are not biological tissues, and their role and structure are different from ligaments. Therefore, ligaments are the correct answer.	A
Which osteoconductive ceramic material is most commonly used for artificial bones?	carbon ceramics	alumina (Al2O3)	hydroxyapatite	zirconia (ZrO2)	Hydroxyapatite is the most commonly used osteoconductive ceramic material for artificial bones because it has a chemical structure similar to that of human bone. It is used to more naturally integrate artificial bones with real bones.	Hydroxyapatite has a chemical structure similar to that of human bone, making it the most commonly used ceramic material for artificial bones. Additionally, it has excellent biocompatibility and can be naturally resorbed and replaced within the human body, which is a significant advantage.	C
In the state of hyperkalemia, where there is an excess of K+ outside the cells, the phenomenon of delayed depolarization occurs. What is the ECG finding in this case?	The T wave is lowered.	The U wave disappears.	The P wave is heightened.	The QRS complex widens (Widening).	In the state of hyperkalemia, the excess extracellular K+ reduces the potential difference across the myocardial cells, leading to a reduction in the potential difference. This causes a delay in the QRS complex, resulting in a widening of the QRS wave. Therefore, the correct answer is 'The QRS complex widens (Widening).'	In the state of hyperkalemia, the potential difference across myocardial cells decreases, leading to a reduction in the potential difference gap, and as a result, the QRS wave widens. Therefore, the correct answer is 'The QRS complex widens (Widening).' The P wave is related to the potential difference of atrial cells and is not directly associated with hyperkalemia. The T wave is related to the potential difference of ventricular cells, and the U wave is a waveform that is not normally visible, so it is not related to hyperkalemia.	D
Which of the following is NOT a common characteristic of biomedical metal materials?	They have high strength and are easily deformable.	They are good conductors of heat and electricity.	They have a low specific gravity and a metallic luster.	They are solid at room temperature.	The characteristic that they have a low specific gravity and a metallic luster is not a common feature, but rather specific to certain biomedical metal materials. This property is considered when selecting materials for medical devices with regard to aesthetic factors and weight reduction.	Having a low specific gravity and a metallic luster is not a common characteristic of biomedical metal materials. Biomedical metal materials are solid at room temperature, have high strength, are easily deformable, and are good conductors of heat and electricity.	C
What is the energy of the gamma rays used in PET?	311keV	511keV	411keV	611keV	The radioactive isotopes used in PET decay through positron emission, and when a positron meets an electron, they annihilate each other, emitting gamma-ray photons. The energy of these gamma-ray photons is approximately equal to the sum of the mass and kinetic energy of the positron and electron, which is about 511keV. Therefore, the correct answer is '511keV'.	The gamma rays used in PET are produced during the positron emission process from a positronium complex. This complex forms as the electron and positron attract each other, and upon annihilation, they emit gamma rays. The energy of these gamma rays is approximately 511keV. This is because the energy corresponds to the mass energy of the positron and electron. Therefore, the energy of the gamma rays used in PET is 511keV.	B
Which device is used to prevent the degradation of image resolution due to Compton scattering in radiographic imaging equipment?	Image intensifier	Grid	X-ray film	Solid-state flat panel detector	A grid is used to prevent the degradation of image resolution caused by Compton scattering of X-rays. The grid functions by allowing X-rays to pass through while filtering out scattered X-rays, thereby improving image resolution.	Compton scattering refers to the phenomenon where X-rays change direction and scatter after interacting with matter. This scattering is one of the factors that can reduce the resolution of an image. A grid is a device used to prevent such scattering; it filters out the scattered light that comes in, helping to obtain an accurate image. Therefore, the grid is an important device used in radiographic imaging equipment to enhance image resolution.	B
Among the components of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, which device is considered most important alongside the arterial pump, as it supplies oxygen to venous blood and also removes carbon dioxide?	Filter	Oxygenator	Venous cannula	Heat exchanger	The oxygenator in a cardiopulmonary bypass machine is responsible for supplying oxygen to venous blood and removing carbon dioxide. This is an essential function for maintaining life in an artificially created environment and is a core role of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. Therefore, the oxygenator is one of the most important devices in a cardiopulmonary bypass machine.	The oxygenator is a component of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine that is responsible for the supply of oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide. The oxygenator takes in ventilation air during the ventilation process to supply oxygen, and it removes carbon dioxide from the ventilation air to maintain the concentration of carbon dioxide produced in the body. Therefore, the oxygenator is one of the most important components of a cardiopulmonary bypass machine.	B
Which ventilator mode is used for a patient who has completely transitioned from mandatory to spontaneous breathing?	P-SIMV	SPONT	V-CMV	P-CMV	SPONT is a mode that supports spontaneous breathing and is used when the patient is able to breathe on their own. Other modes induce or control breathing mandatorily, so SPONT mode is appropriate when the patient can breathe spontaneously.	SPONT mode is used when the patient can breathe spontaneously. In this mode, the ventilator supports the patient's breathing, allowing the patient to control their own breathing. Therefore, SPONT mode is used when the patient has completely transitioned from mandatory to spontaneous breathing. P-CMV, V-CMV, and P-SIMV modes are all modes that support artificial ventilation, but they differ from SPONT mode in that they do not allow the patient to control their breathing.	B
When the distance from the X-ray tube to the imaged object is 50 cm, how far should the distance from the X-ray tube to the X-ray detector be to achieve a magnification of 4 times?	50cm	100cm	150cm	200cm	The magnification is calculated by the ratio of the distance between the object and the image to the distance between the detector and the image. Therefore, to achieve a magnification of 4 times, the distance between the detector and the image must be 4 times the distance between the object and the image. Since the distance between the object and the image is 50cm, the distance between the detector and the image must be 50cm x 4 = 200cm. Hence, the correct answer is '200cm'.	The magnification is determined by the distance between the object being imaged and the detector, and the distance between the detector and the image. To increase the magnification by 4 times, the distance between the detector and the image must be increased by 4 times. Since the distance between the object being imaged and the detector is fixed, the distance between the detector and the X-ray tube must be increased by 4 times. Therefore, the distance from the X-ray tube to the X-ray detector becomes 200cm.	D
Which of the following is a correct description about the codification of medical data?	Coding improves the accessibility of data.	Medical statistics and research become more difficult.	Assigning numeric codes makes it easier to recall items.	Coding medical data leads to an increase in the quantity of data.	By coding, assigning numeric codes to each item makes it easier to classify and search data, and improves data accessibility, which facilitates data analysis and research.	When medical data is coded, numeric codes can be assigned to each item, which improves the accessibility of data. This is very useful for medical statistics and research. Therefore, 'Coding improves the accessibility of data.' is the correct answer.	A
Which of the following is NOT a component of a lower limb prosthesis?	Exoskeleton	Foot	Socket	Prosthetic arm	A prosthetic arm is not a part of the human body, therefore it is not a component of a lower limb prosthesis. The components of a lower limb prosthesis include the foot, exoskeleton, and socket.	The correct answer is 'Prosthetic arm'. The socket serves to connect mechanical parts, the foot provides stability as it supports the weight of the body, and the exoskeleton protects the exterior of the product and determines its design. However, a prosthetic arm performs the functions of a product and plays a core role in the product's operation, but it is not related to lower limb prostheses.	D
Which of the following gases is NOT used in anesthesia?	Air	Carbon Monoxide	Nitrogen	Oxygen	Carbon monoxide is not used as an anesthetic gas. This gas is toxic and very dangerous to the human body. Therefore, only safe gases like air, oxygen, and nitrogen are used during anesthesia.	Carbon monoxide is the answer because it is a toxic gas, not a medical gas. When inhaled into the respiratory system, carbon monoxide binds with oxygen, preventing the formation of carbon dioxide and instead forms carboxyhemoglobin in the blood, which blocks oxygen supply and can lead to poisoning symptoms. Therefore, it is not used in the medical field.	B
Which of the following is NOT a consideration when measuring biometric signals?	Noise other than the measurement signal should be removed.	Minimize the risk of harm to the human body.	Measurements are not affected by temperature, humidity, noise, sterilization, etc., so they do not need to be considered.	Acquire the correct sensor attachment location and operation method of the measuring instrument.	The statement that measurements are not affected by temperature, humidity, noise, sterilization, etc., and therefore do not need to be considered is is not a consideration when measuring biometric signals because these factors can affect biometric signal measurements.	The answer is 'Measurements are not affected by temperature, humidity, noise, sterilization, etc., so they do not need to be considered.' The reason is that biometric signal measurement should minimize the risk of harm to the human body, therefore, noise other than the measurement signal should be removed, and the correct sensor attachment location and operation method of the measuring instrument should be acquired.

Which of the following descriptions about the thermal properties of the body is incorrect?	Heat transport within human tissues is mostly due to the circulation of blood.	Muscle conducts heat more easily than fat.	Heat dissipation primarily occurs through respiration.	Infants have a higher heat dissipation per body weight compared to adults.	The statement that heat dissipation primarily occurs through respiration is incorrect. In reality, heat dissipation occurs not only through respiration but also through various biological activities such as eating, metabolism, and exercise. Respiration is one of the processes that release heat, but not all heat dissipation occurs through respiration.	The description that heat dissipation primarily occurs through respiration is not correct. Heat dissipation occurs across a range of metabolic activities, not just respiration. Metabolic activities include food intake, exercise, temperature regulation, and other various biological activities. These metabolic activities generate and release heat.	C
Which of the following is not a diagnostic radiation generating device?	Diagnostic X-ray device	Mammography device	Computed tomography (CT) device	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device	The MRI device does not use radiation but generates images using magnetic fields and radio waves, so it is not considered a diagnostic radiation generating device.	The MRI device is not considered a diagnostic radiation generating device because it does not use radiation. Devices such as mammography devices, diagnostic X-ray devices, and computed tomography (CT) devices all use radiation to assist in diagnosis.	D
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of the passive properties of biological tissues?	Unique reflective scattering properties	Frequency dependence	Anisotropy	Electrical insulation	The passive properties of biological tissues do not include electrical insulation. This is because biological tissues are electrically conductive. Therefore, to transmit or measure electrical signals, it is necessary to make direct contact with the biological tissues using electrodes.	The passive characteristics of biological tissues vary depending on the composition and properties of the tissue. Among these, 'electrical insulation' does not appear as a passive characteristic of biological tissues. The reason is that biological tissues have electrically active properties. For example, nerve tissues play a role in transmitting electrical signals, and muscle tissues respond to electrical stimuli by contracting, indicating that they are electrically active. Therefore, biological tissues are not electrically insulated; rather, they have electrically active properties.	D
Which of the following actions does not occur in the human body when excessive current flows?	Stimulative action	Non-thermal action	Thermal action	Optical action	The effects that occur in the human body when excessive current flows include 'thermal action', 'stimulative action', and 'non-thermal action'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'optical action'. Optical action refers to the effects of light or rays on the human body, which is unrelated to electrical action.	The effects that occur in the human body when excessive current flows include thermal action, chemical action, and magnetic action. However, optical action is a phenomenon unrelated to current and is not an effect that occurs when excessive current flows through the body. Optical action refers to the interaction of light with objects, resulting in phenomena such as refraction, reflection, and absorption.	D
Which method of generating energy in an extracorporeal shock wave lithotripter involves focusing pressure waves generated by vibrating a metal membrane with an electromagnet to create shock waves?	Piezoelectric element method	Electromagnetic vibration method	Micro-explosion method	Underwater discharge method	The extracorporeal shock wave lithotripter operates by focusing pressure waves generated by vibrating a metal membrane with an electromagnet to create shock waves. This is classified as the electromagnetic vibration method.	Among the energy sources for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripters, the method that creates shock waves by focusing pressure waves generated by vibrating a metal membrane with an electromagnet is known as the 'electromagnetic vibration method'. This method uses an electromagnet to vibrate a metal membrane, generating pressure waves, and is one of the most common methods for creating shock waves.	B
What are the conditions that must be met for biomaterials to satisfy biocompatibility?	The biomaterial should not cause inflammation or allergies in the surrounding tissues	The biomaterial should not exhibit toxicity within the body	The biomaterial should have sufficient mechanical strength to perform its function	The biomaterial should not inhibit biological functions	Biomaterials are materials used inside the human body; therefore, they should not exhibit toxicity, inhibit biological functions, or cause inflammation or allergies in the surrounding tissues. Additionally, since biomaterials perform mechanical roles within the body, they must possess sufficient mechanical strength to function effectively. Thus, 'The biomaterial should have sufficient mechanical strength to perform its function' is one of the conditions that must be met for biomaterials to satisfy biocompatibility.	Biomaterials, being used within the body, must not inhibit biological functions and must not exhibit toxicity. Moreover, biomaterials need to have sufficient mechanical strength to perform effectively. This is because materials used inside the body must maintain a certain level of mechanical strength. Lastly, biomaterials should not cause inflammation or allergies in the surrounding tissues. This is to minimize potential side effects that can occur during interactions between the biomaterial and the surrounding tissues.	C
Which of the following is not related to the sympathetic nervous system?	Its center is located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord at the thoracolumbar level.	It increases the secretion of digestive juices.	It is activated when stress increases.	It causes constriction of the blood vessels that perfuse glands.	The increase in the secretion of digestive juices is not related to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is activated when stress increases, and its center is located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord at the thoracolumbar level. Although the sympathetic nervous system causes constriction of the blood vessels that perfuse glands, it is not directly related to the secretion of digestive juices.	The statement 'It increases the secretion of digestive juices.' is not related to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system becomes more active in stressful situations and causes the constriction of blood vessels that perfuse glands, but it typically reduces the secretion of digestive juices, not increases it. The statement 'Its center is located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord at the thoracolumbar level.' is correct and related to the sympathetic nervous system, and 'It is activated when stress increases.' is also a correct statement related to the sympathetic nervous system.	B
Which piece of clinical diagnostic equipment separates solid particles in a liquid by spinning the sample and using the force to separate, purify, and concentrate components with specific weights or densities?	Biochemistry analyzer	Centrifuge	Automated cell counter	Blood gas analyzer	The centrifuge is suitable for separating solid particles in a liquid by spinning the sample and using the action of centrifugal force to separate components. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Centrifuge'.	The centrifuge is the correct answer because it uses the technique of spinning the sample and applying centrifugal force to concentrate, purify, and separate solid particles in a liquid. The other options are: an automated cell counter, which automatically counts the number of cells in the blood; a blood gas analyzer, which measures the concentration of gases in the blood; and a biochemistry analyzer, which measures the concentration of biochemical substances in the body.	B
Which of the following statements about radiation therapy is incorrect?	Radiation only causes damage to cancerous tissue and has no effect on normal tissue.	Radiation energy is transferred to the atoms and molecules that make up the human body, altering the composition of compounds.	Radiation is selected based on the location of the tumor.	Most cells that receive radiation experience functional impairment during cell division and proliferation is hindered.	The statement that radiation only causes damage to cancerous tissue and has no effect on normal tissue is incorrect. Radiation can affect not only cancerous tissue but also the surrounding normal tissue. This is because even when radiation is focused on cancerous tissue, the surrounding normal tissue can also receive some radiation. Therefore, it is important in radiation therapy to target the cancerous tissue as much as possible while minimizing the impact on surrounding normal tissue.	The statement that radiation only causes damage to cancerous tissue and has no effect on normal tissue is incorrect. In reality, radiation therapy can affect not only cancerous tissue but also the surrounding normal tissue. This is because radiation is absorbed by all tissues, including both cancerous and surrounding normal tissues. Therefore, during radiation therapy, it is crucial to destroy the cancerous tissue as effectively as possible while minimizing side effects on the surrounding normal tissue.	A
Which of the following is a correct description of the types of synovial joints?	Ball-and-socket joint: The head of the joint is ball-shaped and the socket is deep and concave, allowing for the greatest range of motion in various planes.	Saddle joint: The articulating surfaces are shaped like a saddle, allowing movement in two perpendicular directions.	Plane joint: The articulating surfaces are flat, and the joint is surrounded by a tight joint capsule and strong ligaments, limiting movement.	Ellipsoidal joint: The head of the joint is oval-shaped, allowing movement along the long and short axes, but rotation is not possible.	The plane joint has flat articulating surfaces and is surrounded by a tight joint capsule and ligaments, which limit its movement.	The correct answer 'Plane joint: The articulating surfaces are flat, and the joint is surrounded by a tight joint capsule and strong ligaments, limiting movement.' explains that this type of joint has flat articulating surfaces and is encased in a joint capsule and ligaments, which restrict its movement. This implies that compared to other joints, it has less movement and higher stability.	C
Which statement about the form of energy in a defibrillator is incorrect?	When using biphasic waveforms, the size of the energy is increased.	Biphasic waveforms do not flow current in only one direction, but the current that flows from one pole moves to the other, making the waveform shape fluctuate up and down.	Monophasic waveforms allow current to flow in only one direction.	Defibrillators using biphasic waveforms can be smaller and lighter than monophasic ones, making them more versatile in use.	The statement that the size of the energy is increased when using biphasic waveforms is incorrect. Biphasic waveforms produce the same amount of energy as monophasic waveforms, but because the direction of the current changes, it reduces motor vibration and allows for smoother operation. Therefore, using biphasic waveforms does not increase the size of the energy.	The statement that the size of the energy is increased when using biphasic waveforms is incorrect. Biphasic waveforms do not increase the size of the energy; rather, they have a higher frequency of current direction changes, which improves the performance of the defibrillator. This has the advantage of allowing for smoother operation and more precise speed control compared to monophasic waveforms.	A
Which material is unsuitable for needle electrodes inserted into the human body?	Gold (Au)	Zinc (Zn)	Platinum (Pt)	Stainless steel	Needle electrodes inserted into the human body must have high biocompatibility and should not corrode or be toxic. Therefore, zinc is unsuitable for needle electrodes because it corrodes quickly and is toxic. On the other hand, gold, platinum, and stainless steel have high biocompatibility and are not corrosive or toxic, making them suitable for needle electrodes.	Needle electrodes inserted into human skin must be made of materials with high biocompatibility because the needle itself enters the body. Among them, gold (Au), platinum (Pt), and stainless steel are known to be highly biocompatible materials. However, zinc (Zn) has low biocompatibility and is unsuitable for insertion into the body. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Zinc (Zn)'.	B
Which of the following are methods of solute removal used only in hemodialysis?	Convection, Ultrafiltration	Diffusion, Ultrafiltration	Diffusion, Convection, Ultrafiltration	Diffusion, Convection	In hemodialysis, the methods of solute removal are diffusion and convection. Diffusion is the movement of particles due to a concentration gradient, while convection is the movement of particles due to a pressure gradient. Therefore, 'Diffusion, Convection' is the correct answer. Ultrafiltration, which filters particles based on size, is not included as a method of solute removal.	The methods of solute removal in hemodialysis primarily involve diffusion and convection. Diffusion is the natural movement of particles due to a concentration gradient, and it utilizes the concentration difference between blood and dialysate to remove solutes. Convection is the movement of particles along with the flow of liquid, and it removes solutes by causing blood to flow through the dialysate. Therefore, among the listed options for methods of solute removal in hemodialysis, diffusion and convection are included, and the correct answer is 'Diffusion, Convection'.	D
Which of the following is NOT a use for medical gas?	For artificial respiration	For anesthesia	For special welding	For emergency medical services	Special welding gas is not a medical gas but uses gases such as oxygen and acetylene for welding purposes. Therefore, 'For special welding' is not a use for medical gas.	Special welding gas is used for welding operations, while the other three types of gases are used in the medical field. Emergency medical gas is used to assist breathing in urgent situations, anesthetic medical gas is used to maintain a state of insensibility in patients during surgery, and artificial respiration medical gas is used to help patients who have difficulty breathing due to respiratory diseases.	C
Which of the following descriptions about microelectrodes is incorrect?	It is an electrode used to measure the action potential of cells.	The length of this electrode is about 0.05 to 10 micrometers.	A metal microelectrode is said to be one that contains an electrolyte solution inside a glass capillary.	There are metal microelectrodes, glass micropipette microelectrodes, etc.	The answer is 'A metal microelectrode is said to be one that contains an electrolyte solution inside a glass capillary.' The reason is that a metal microelectrode is an electrode made of metal, and the one that contains an electrolyte solution inside a glass capillary is called a glass micropipette microelectrode.	The statement 'A metal microelectrode is said to be one that contains an electrolyte solution inside a glass capillary.' is incorrect. Metal microelectrodes are small electrodes made of metal, whereas glass micropipette microelectrodes are the ones that contain an electrolyte solution inside a glass capillary. - Microelectrodes refer to electrodes that are very small in size. - Among microelectrodes, those with a length of about 0.05 to 10 micrometers are referred to as microelectrodes. - Microelectrodes are used to measure potentials or chemical substances in small spaces such as cells or tissues. - There are metal microelectrodes, glass micropipette microelectrodes, etc.	C
What is the biomaterial that gradually degrades or gets absorbed by the body tissue over time after being implanted into the body tissue?	Bioresorbable material	Bioinert material	Bioactive material	Biocomposite material	Bioresorbable materials are materials that slowly degrade or get absorbed by the body tissue after being implanted, eventually disappearing. Therefore, they are used in medical fields such as organ transplantation, where they gradually degrade and naturally dissolve into the body tissue after the transplantation.	Bioresorbable materials are materials that, after being implanted into body tissue, slowly degrade over time and are absorbed by the body. As a result, they completely disappear after a certain period. In contrast, biocomposite materials, bioinert materials, and bioactive materials remain in the body for a certain period and perform various functions according to their characteristics.	A
