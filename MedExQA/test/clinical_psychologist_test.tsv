Which counseling technique involves encouraging the client to intentionally exaggerate their anticipated anxiety and fear?	Correction of irrational thoughts	Self-expression training	Paradoxical intention	Role-playing	Paradoxical intention is a counseling technique that encourages the client to express their anxiety or fear humorously, allowing them to take their feelings a bit more lightly. It does not directly negate the client's emotions but indirectly stimulates their sense of humor, helping them to see their emotions from a different perspective. Therefore, 'Paradoxical intention' is the correct answer.	Correct Answer: Paradoxical intention. Explanation: Paradoxical intention is a counseling technique designed to confront the client with unexpected anxiety and fear that they might avoid or obsess over. When a client tends to avoid anxiety, this technique encourages them to face it by humorously exaggerating the anxiety. This approach allows the client to gain a new perspective on their anxiety and can help them overcome it.	C
Which of the following is least related to the precautions that should be taken when interpreting psychological test results?	The results should be presented from a perspective of possibilities rather than making specific predictions.	The purpose, limitations, and strengths of the test taken by the client should be reviewed.	The strengths revealed by the test results should be primarily emphasized.	The first step in test interpretation is knowing and understanding the test manual.	The reason why the strengths revealed by the test results should not be primarily emphasized is that it can lead to a biased interpretation that overlooks potential areas for improvement or challenges the client may be facing. While it is important to acknowledge the client's strengths, a balanced approach that considers both strengths and weaknesses is crucial for accurate and helpful feedback.	The precaution that should be taken when interpreting psychological test results is that 'the results should be presented from a perspective of possibilities rather than making specific predictions.' This is because test results provide possibilities, not predictions. Therefore, interpretations should consider possibilities rather than making specific predictions. The least related option is 'The purpose, limitations, and strengths of the test taken by the client should be reviewed.' While the purpose, limitations, and strengths of the test are related to the context in which the test was taken, they do not directly influence the interpretation of the test results.	C
What is the therapeutic technique that involves setting desirable target behaviors for adolescents, and then providing gradual reinforcement as they exhibit behaviors that is closed to the desired ones?	Role-playing	Systematic desensitization	Restructuring	Behavior shaping	Behavior shaping is a therapeutic technique that involves setting desirable target behaviors and providing gradual reinforcement as the individual exhibits behaviors that approximate these targets, thereby facilitating the development of the desirable behavior. Therefore, this technique is effective in helping adolescents to habituate desirable behaviors.	Behavior shaping is a therapeutic technique where the client sets desirable target behaviors and receives differential reinforcement for exhibiting behaviors that approximate these targets, thus progressively moving towards the desirable behavior. This technique is used to regulate and improve the client's behavior, and it involves creating a plan to achieve the target behaviors and executing this plan, which allows the client to feel a sense of accomplishment and regain confidence. Therefore, behavior shaping is the correct answer.	D
What method did researchers like Kinsey primarily use to study human sexual behavior in men and women?	Survey method	Test method	Observation method	Experimental method	Kinsey and others primarily used the survey method to study human sexual behavior. This involved collecting and analyzing information about the sexual behaviors of men and women through large-scale surveys. Through this, they gathered a variety of information on sexual behavior and contributed to changing perceptions and attitudes towards sex.	The main method used by Kinsey and others to study the sexual behavior of men and women was the survey method. This method involves collecting and analyzing information about human sexual behavior through large-scale surveys. Unlike experimental or test methods, the survey method does not directly manipulate or measure human sexual behavior. Instead, it collects information about human experiences and perceptions to enhance understanding of sexual behavior.	A
Which of the following is NOT an appropriate description of a controlled observation?	Stress interviews are a type of controlled observation.	It is a type that induces the behavior of interest in a mock experiment setting.	Role-playing is the most commonly used type of controlled observation.	Self-monitoring techniques are a type of controlled observation.	Self-monitoring techniques are not a type of controlled observation. Self-monitoring involves an individual observing and recording their own behavior, which is a voluntary observation method. Therefore, this option is not appropriate.	The statement that 'Self-monitoring techniques are not a type of controlled observation.' is incorrect. While role-playing is one type of controlled observation, it is not the most commonly used one. The statement that 'Self-monitoring techniques are a type of controlled observation.' is incorrect. Self-monitoring involves participants recording or reporting their own behavior, which is not a form of controlled observation. Controlled observation is correctly described as inducing the behavior of interest in a mock experiment setting.	D
Which of the following is a positive symptom of schizophrenia?	Poverty of speech	Hallucinations	Apathy	Blunted affect	Hallucinations involve seeing, hearing, or feeling things that do not actually exist, which means experiencing something unrelated to reality, and therefore, they are considered positive symptoms.	Hallucinations involve seeing, hearing, or feeling things that do not actually exist, which means experiencing something unrelated to reality. This is one of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, creating a gap with reality and potentially disrupting the patient's daily life.	B
Which of the following statements about behavior therapy is incorrect?	Assessment and treatment are directly related.	The assessment and treatment procedures are specific and clear.	Rather than applying the same technique to all cases, individualized assessment and intervention are conducted.	It places importance on the underlying causes of problem behaviors.	The statement that it places importance on the underlying causes of problem behaviors is incorrect. In behavior therapy, identifying self-destructive or unhealthy behaviors is essential, not the causes.	The statement that 'It places importance on the underlying causes of problem behaviors.' is incorrect regarding behavior therapy. Understanding how changing their behaviors can lead changes in how they are feeling is important. So, the therapy focuses on identifying problem behaviors rather than the underlying causes.	D
Which methods of measuring the validity of a psychological test involves logically analyzing and reviewing whether the content of the test matches the attribute it aims to measure?	Construct validity	Predictive validity	Content validity	Concurrent validity	Validity is an indicator that evaluates whether a test accurately measures the attribute it intends to measure. Content validity involves logically analyzing and reviewing whether the content of the test matches the attribute it aims to measure, assessing whether the test sufficiently reflects the attribute. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is 'Content validity'.	Content validity is a method that involves logically analyzing and reviewing whether the content of the test matches the attribute it aims to measure. In other words, it checks whether the test is composed of content related to the attribute it aims to measure. Therefore, in this question, since it is about verifying whether the content of the test matches the attribute it aims to measure, the correct answer is Content validity.	C
Which of the following is NOT one of the nine aptitude areas presented in the GATB vocational aptitude test?	Finger dexterity	Spatial aptitude	Relationship perception	Clerical perception	The correct answer is 'Relationship perception'. 'Relationship perception' refers to the ability to grasp and understand relationships between people. It does not refer to a measurable skill related to cognitive or motor abilities relevant to vocational testing. Instead, it implies an understanding of social or interpersonal dynamics, which is not a focus of the GATB.	'Relationship perception' is not one of the nine aptitude areas presented in the GATB vocational aptitude test. 'Relationship perception' refers to the ability to interact with others, form interpersonal relationships, and understand the emotions and behaviors of others. The GATB tests General Learning Ability, Verbal Aptitude, Numerical Aptitude, Spatial Aptitude, Form Perception, Clerical Perception, Motor Coordination, Finger Dexterity, and Manual Dexterity.	C
Which of the following is the least relevant to behavioral assessment?	Personality traits	Antecedent conditions	Target behavior	Behavioral consequences	Personality traits are internal characteristics of an individual's personality, which are not directly related to externally observable behavior, making them difficult to specify in behavioral assessment. Behavioral assessment primarily focuses on specifying externally observable behaviors, the antecedent conditions required for those behaviors to occur, and the target behaviors and their consequences.	Personality traits are internal characteristics of an individual's personality and have no direct correlation with externally observable behavior in behavioral assessment, making them difficult to specify. In contrast, behavioral consequences are the outcomes of behavior, target behavior is the action taken to achieve a specific goal, and antecedent conditions are the conditions necessary to perform a behavior. All of these can be externally observed and are easier to specify. Therefore, personality traits are the most difficult to specify.	A
Which scale is NOT included in the Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological assessment items?	Motor	Tactile	Concentration	Rhythm	The scale not included in the Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological assessment items is 'Concentration'. This is because the Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological assessment evaluates areas such as cognition, motor functions, sensation, language, memory, emotion, and reasoning, but it does not assess concentration.	The Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological assessment includes scales for 'Motor', 'Rhythm', and 'Tactile', but does not include a scale for 'Concentration'. This is because the Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological assessment evaluates various domains such as cognition, language, motor functions, sensation, and emotion, and concentration is not one of these domains.	C
Which model of drug addiction intervention focuses on spiritual growth and utilizes self-help groups?	12-Step Model	Subculture Model	Public Health Model	Motivational Enhancement Model	The 12-Step Model is a model created by alcoholics, which centers around the healing process of spiritual growth and self-help groups. This educational model helps individuals overcome addiction through high self-reflection and spiritual growth, not only through personal will and effort, but also by starting their lives anew. It strengthens an individual's problem-solving abilities and utilizes elements of the sociocultural and public health models through self-help groups.	The 12-Step Model is one of the models for alcohol and other drug addiction interventions, which is centered around spiritual growth and self-help groups. This model emphasizes that addicts recognize their problems and receive spiritual support to improve their lives. Additionally, sharing experiences, supporting each other, and encouraging one another through self-help groups is considered important. Therefore, the '12-Step Model' is a model that utilizes spiritual support and self-help groups for addicts to recognize their problems and improve their lives.	A
Which behavior therapy technique is closely related to Wӧlpe's reciprocal inhibition principle?	Behavior shaping	Systematic desensitization	Positive reinforcement	Aversion therapy	Wӧlpe's reciprocal inhibition principle states that two mutually exclusive responses cannot occur at the same time. Therefore, by strengthening one response, the other is inhibited. Utilizing this principle, systematic desensitization exposes a person gradually to a stimulus that elicits negative emotions such as anxiety or fear, while simultaneously providing positive experiences that reduce these negative emotions. This behavior therapy technique suppresses the negative emotions and reinforces positive emotions. Thus, systematic desensitization is closely related to Wӧlpe's reciprocal inhibition principle.	Wӧlpe's reciprocal inhibition principle is based on the idea that two mutually exclusive responses cannot occur at the same time. To reduce anxiety or fear associated with a situation, one must practice a non-fearful response simultaneously with the stimulus that induces fear. One of the behavior therapy techniques used for this purpose is systematic desensitization. This technique involves hierarchically arranging the stimuli that induce fear, starting with those that do not induce fear and gradually moving to more fear-inducing stimuli, while repeatedly practicing. Through this process, one practices a non-fearful response along with a desensitized response to the fear-inducing stimulus, which can reduce fear.	B
Which subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale is likely to show decreased performance in children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?	Digit Span	Similarities	Block Design	Vocabulary	Children with ADHD may have difficulties with subtests that require prolonged attention and complex tasks due to deficits in attention and concentration. However, the Digit Span subtest can be performed in a relatively short amount of time and measures the ability to remember and manipulate numbers, which can minimize performance decrements in children with ADHD. Therefore, the Digit Span subtest is suitable for children with ADHD.	The correct answer is 'Digit Span.' Children with ADHD have difficulties with concentration and are prone to hyperactivity due to deficits in attention and their impulsive characteristics, which makes them better suited for concrete and simple subtests rather than complex or abstract ones. The 'Digit Span' subtest requires simple calculation and concentration, and measures the ability to remember numbers and maintain their sequence, making it useful for identifying performance decrements in children with ADHD.	A
During the group counseling process, in which stage should the leader intervene immediately to handle the resistance and defense of the group members, and provide support and challenge for problem-solving?	Conflict stage	Cohesion stage	Termination stage	Productive stage	The conflict stage is the phase in the group counseling process where group members have different opinions or attitudes and clash with each other. At this time, the leader must actively intervene to handle the resistance and defense of the group members, and provide the necessary support and challenge to resolve the conflict. Therefore, the role of the leader is very important during the conflict stage.	The correct answer is 'Conflict stage'. The conflict stage is the phase in the group counseling process where group members have different opinions or attitudes and clash with each other. At this time, the leader must actively intervene to handle the resistance and defense of the group members, and provide support and challenge for problem-solving. Through this, the leader can resolve the conflicts among group members, enhance the cohesion of the group, and move towards a more productive stage.	A
What is the most appropriate intelligence test for a 6-year-old child suspected of intellectual disability?	H-T-P	K-WPPSI	K-WAIS-4	BGT-2	The K-WPPSI is the most suitable intelligence test for a child aged 6 years. It is a version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, intended for children from 2 to 7 years and 3 months old. Therefore, it is an appropriate test for the child's age and can assess the child's cognitive abilities holistically.	The K-WPPSI is the most suitable intelligence test for a child aged 6 years. It is one of the most widely used intelligence tests for children and is an appropriate tool for assessing a child's cognitive abilities. The H-T-P is a drawing test, the BGT-2 is a non-verbal intelligence test, and the K-WAIS-4 is an intelligence test for adults. Therefore, these are not suitable for testing the intelligence of children.	B
Which of the following statements about confidentiality is incorrect?	Confidentiality must be maintained even if it poses a clear danger to the client themselves or others.	Clients should be informed about the legal limits of confidentiality at an appropriate time.	Information and assessment materials obtained in a professional relationship should only be discussed for professional purposes.	Confidentiality of information obtained from clients should be valued.	The statement that confidentiality must be maintained even if it poses a clear danger to the client themselves or others is incorrect. The safety and welfare of the client are of the utmost importance, and confidentiality should not be prioritized over appropriate measures and protection when it threatens these. Therefore, breaking confidentiality may be necessary in such cases.	The statement that information and assessment materials obtained in a professional relationship should only be discussed for professional purposes is correct. Confidentiality means protecting the information obtained from clients, and it must be maintained unless it poses a clear danger to the client themselves or others. This is to ensure the safety and trust of the client. Clients should be informed about the legal limits of confidentiality at an appropriate time, and the statement that information and assessment materials should only be discussed for professional purposes is indeed correct.	A
According to the DSM-5, which anxiety disorder is characterized by a fear of places or situations where escape is difficult or where help may not be available in case of sudden panic attack?	Claustrophobia	Micropsia	Social Anxiety Disorder	Agoraphobia	The term for the anxiety disorder characterized by anxiety and panic in public places is called 'Agoraphobia,' which includes the word 'agora' meaning a public space.	In the DSM-5, anxiety disorders are characterized by a fear of places or situations where help may not be available. Agoraphobia specifically refers to feeling anxious in wide-open spaces. Therefore, unlike the other options, agoraphobia is classified as an anxiety disorder focused on the experience of anxiety in wide-open spaces.	D
Why does a standardized test allow a more objective interpretation than other tests?	Because norms are established.	Because they are easy to administer.	Because they have high validity.	Because they have high reliability.	Standardized tests allow for objective interpretation because norms are established, ensuring that the same results are obtained under the same conditions.	Standardized tests enable objective interpretation because they have established norms. This means that everyone administering the test can interpret the results using the same criteria. Therefore, such tests tend to have higher validity and reliability, and they also become easier to administer.	A
Which of the following is NOT one of the three components of attitude?	Evaluative component	Cognitive component	Attributional component	Behavioral component	The three components of attitude are the cognitive component, the evaluative component, and the behavioral component. The attributional component is not a component of attitude, therefore the correct answer is 'Attributional component'.	The correct answer is 'Attributional component'. The cognitive component refers to the cognitive aspects of attitude formation, such as an individual's knowledge, beliefs, and experiences. The evaluative component, often confused with the 'emotional component' in some texts, refers to the emotional aspects of attitude formation, such as an individual's feelings, emotional responses, and preferences. The behavioral component refers to the behavioral aspects of attitude, such as an individual's actions, intentions of actions, and outcomes of actions. However, the attributional component is not a component of attitude; it is rather related to concepts of an individual's personality, morality, and ethics. Therefore, the attributional component is not a component of attitude.	C
Which of the following statements is correct regarding the characteristics of achievement tests and aptitude tests?	Achievement is considered to be more influenced by genetics, while aptitude is considered to be more influenced by the environment.	Most scholars consider aptitude to be a general ability rather than a special ability.	The difference between achievement tests and aptitude tests lies in the format of the questions.	Achievement is past-oriented, while aptitude is future-oriented.	Achievement tests measure past learning outcomes, while aptitude tests assess an individual's future potential and latent abilities. Therefore, it can be said that achievement is past-oriented and aptitude is future-oriented.	The correct answer is 'Achievement is past-oriented, while aptitude is future-oriented.' Achievement tests measure past learning outcomes or knowledge levels, so they are past-oriented. On the other hand, aptitude tests predict an individual's future possibilities or potential for growth, making them future-oriented. The format of the questions is one of the differences between the two tests, but it is not a significant factor in explaining the characteristics of the tests. Both achievement and aptitude are influenced by genetics and the environment, so both tests should consider genetic and environmental influences. Lastly, the statement that most scholars consider aptitude to be a general ability rather than a special ability is irrelevant to this question.	D
Which of the following situations is least likely to result in conformity?	When the pressure of the group against deviance is burdensome	When an individual's personal conviction or certainty is strong	When there is a high motivation to gain the approval of the majority	When one receives information from others that they did not previously know	When an individual's personal conviction or certainty is strong, the influence of other opinions is less because it aligns with what they already believe, resulting in the least occurrence of conformity.	When an individual's personal conviction or certainty is strong, they are less likely to be influenced by the opinions or thoughts of others because their own thoughts or beliefs are already strong. Therefore, this is the situation where conformity is least likely to occur.	B
Which type of aphasia is characterized by reduced fluency, stuttering speech, inability to speak at length, and abnormal tone or pronunciation?	Transcortical sensory aphasia	Broca's aphasia	Wernicke's aphasia	Conduction aphasia	Broca's aphasia is a condition where the ability to understand spoken language remains intact, but the ability to select and articulate speech sounds is impaired. This is due to damage in the brain's Broca's area, making it difficult to speak and construct sentences.	Broca's aphasia is a type of aphasia that occurs due to damage to the Broca's area of the brain, which is responsible for speech production. This results in difficulty speaking, stuttering, and awkward pronunciation. It also leads to reduced fluency and the inability to speak at length.	B
Which of the following is least related to the cause of antisocial personality disorder?	Deficiency of the neurotransmitter serotonin	Capricious and impulsive parenting attitude	Collapsed ego and strong moral development	Parental hostility and abuse	Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a disregard for social norms and moral standards, and by infringing on the rights of others. Therefore, a collapsed ego and strong moral development are unrelated. A collapsed ego implies a weakened self-concept, making it difficult to find one's identity, and strong moral development actually emphasizes the importance of social norms and moral standards. Thus, these are not related to antisocial personality disorder.	Antisocial personality disorder is mainly caused by negative home environments experienced during childhood, parenting attitudes of parents, and genetic factors, among others. Among the options, 'collapsed ego and strong moral development' is the least related because it is actually one of the symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. Individuals with this disorder tend to lack their own values or moral standards, or they ignore the emotions and rights of others and pursue their own interests. Therefore, they typically have a deficiency in moral development and are in a state of a collapsed ego.	C
Which form of interpretation is NOT appropriate in counseling?	Presentation in the form of questions	Definitive expressions	Repetitive presentation	Gradual progression	Definitive expressions are not appropriate because they involve the counselor making certain conclusions or speaking on behalf of the client's thoughts or feelings, which can tend to ignore or impose on the client's opinions, thus potentially diminishing the effectiveness of the counseling.	Definitive expressions are not appropriate because they involve the counselor making certain conclusions or speaking on behalf of the client's thoughts or feelings, which can be criticized for ignoring or imposing on the client's opinions. Therefore, the answer is 'Definitive expressions'. Gradual progression respects the client's opinions or feelings while slowly moving the conversation forward, repetitive presentation involves saying the same content several times to make it easier for the client to understand, and presentation in the form of questions is about asking questions to elicit the client's thoughts or feelings, all of which are appropriate methods.	B
In Carl Rogers' personality theory, what is assumed to play the most important role in psychological adaptation?	self	awareness	ego ideal	ego strength	In Carl Rogers' personality theory, the self is assumed to play the most important role in psychological adaptation. This is because it enhances an individual's ability to recognize and accept their experiences and emotions, thereby allowing them to regulate and adjust their own lives. The self forms an individual's sense of self and self-ideal, while awareness refers to the individual's ability to recognize and understand their experiences. Therefore, the self and awareness play a very important role in an individual's adaptation and growth.	In Rogers' personality theory, the self is assumed to play the most important role in psychological adaptation. This is because it enhances an individual's ability to recognize and accept their experiences and emotions, thereby enabling them to regulate and adjust their lives. The self forms an individual's ego strength and ego ideal, and through this, an individual can increase their awareness. Therefore, the self plays the most important role in an individual's psychological adaptation.	A
In Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) model, which factor corresponds to the operation factor?	The sum of expectations or anticipations arising from certain information	The evaluation of the appropriateness of the outcomes of thinking	Behavioral information such as expressions and actions	Semantic information of meaningful words or concepts	In Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) model, the operation factor refers to 'The evaluation of the appropriateness of the outcomes of thinking.' This plays an important role in assessing conceptual reasoning and problem-solving abilities. It involves the ability to draw appropriate conclusions from given information or situations and to judge whether those conclusions are suitable for solving the problem. Therefore, this factor is closely related to cognitive abilities.	In Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) model, the operation factor represents the ability to perform cognitive tasks, and among these, 'The evaluation of the appropriateness of the outcomes of thinking' is classified as a factor indicating problem-solving and decision-making abilities. It refers to the ability to judge and decide which choices or actions are appropriate in a given situation. Therefore, this factor is one of the abilities to perform cognitive tasks and plays an important role in assessing problem-solving and decision-making abilities.	B
Which of the following descriptions is least related to the scientist-practitioner model of clinical psychology?	The model emphasizes that clinical psychologists should primarily be psychologists and then become clinicians.	The model emphasizes education in general psychology, psychodynamics of behavior, and adjacent disciplines, in addition to diagnosis, treatment, and research.	Known as the Boulder model, it requires the attainment of a doctoral degree.	It was succeeded by the Vail model in the 1970s, which features an integration of both science and clinical practice.	The statement that the scientist-pratitioner model was succeeded by the Vail model in the 1970s, which features an integration of both science and clinical practice is the farthest from the truth. The scientist-practitioner model, also known as the Boulder model, indeed emphasizes that clinical psychologists should be trained as both scientists and practitioners. This means they should have a strong foundation in general psychology, psychodynamics of behavior, and adjacent disciplines, alongside their training in diagnosis, treatment, and research. The Vail model emerged as an alternative to the Boulder model and places more emphasis on clinical practice rather than research.	The answer is 'It was succeeded by the Vail model in the 1970s, which features an integration of both science and clinical practice.' The reason is that the Vail model, which is also known as the practitioner–scholar model, is an advanced educational and operational model that is focused on practical application of scholarly knowledge. It is the least related to the sicentist-practitioner model.	D
What is it called when we learn by imitating the behavior of parents, friends, or celebrities?	Observational learning	Classical conditioning	Counterconditioning	Operant conditioning	Observational learning refers to learning by observing the behavior of others, such as people or animals, and imitating it. Therefore, learning by imitating the behavior of parents, friends, or celebrities corresponds to observational learning.	Observational learning refers to the process of learning by observing and imitating the behavior of others, such as people or animals. This is often called modeling, and learning by imitating the behavior of parents, friends, or celebrities is a typical example. Such learning can be observed not only in human behavior but also in animal behavior and plays a significant role in social learning and cultural transmission.	A
From a psychoanalytic perspective, what is the primary defense mechanism that causes dissociative disorders?	Intellectualization	Repression	Reaction Formation	Displacement	From a psychoanalytic perspective, the primary defense mechanism that causes dissociative disorders is 'repression'. This is a defense mechanism where an individual unconsciously suppresses and hides anxiety, fear, shame, etc. When such repression persists, unconscious conflicts accumulate, and if they become unbearable, dissociative disorders can occur.	Patients with dissociative disorders feel strong impulses and desires within themselves, but find it difficult to recognize and accept them. Repressing these inner impulses and desires is the most common defense mechanism for patients with dissociative disorders. This is because recognizing and accepting one's inner self feels anxious and dangerous. Therefore, repression is a defense mechanism used by patients with dissociative disorders to protect their inner self and maintain a sense of stability.	B
A father shows his daughter, who is afraid of swimming, how to swim by swimming himself. Which behavioral therapy technique does this correspond to?	Modeling	Counterconditioning	Systematic Desensitization	Aversion Therapy	This corresponds to 'Modeling'. Modeling is showing someone else's behavior to learn the desired behavior. The father teaching his daughter to swim by showing her how to swim himself is an example of modeling.	Correct Answer: Modeling. Modeling is a technique in behavioral therapy that involves showing someone else's behavior to induce the desired behavior. In this case, the father showing his daughter how to swim so that she learns to swim corresponds to modeling. Therefore, the correct answer is modeling.	A
What is the correct thing for a counselor to be aware of during the initial stages of counseling for a sexual abuse survivor?	If the survivor denies the sexual abuse during the first interview, the counselor should continuously encourage them to be open and honest.	The counselor should actively intervene to quickly explore and heal the psychological trauma caused by the sexual abuse.	The counselor should obtain detailed information about the survivor's family situation and any complications from the sexual abuse as early as possible.	Even if the client expresses discomfort, it is important for the counselor to lead the interview to collect detailed information about the abuse situation.	In the initial stages of counseling for a sexual abuse survivor, it is important for the counselor to obtain detailed information about the survivor's family situation and any complications from the sexual abuse as early as possible. This is necessary to better understand the survivor's situation and to provide appropriate support.	During the initial stages of counseling for a sexual abuse survivor, it is important for the counselor to obtain detailed information about the survivor's family situation and any complications from the sexual abuse as early as possible. This is to better understand the survivor's situation and to provide appropriate support. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to minimize the survivor's discomfort and build trust. Therefore, the counselor should alleviate the burden on the survivor and encourage honest conversation while maintaining appropriate boundaries.	C
What is a possible interpretation when the shape of the three validity scales (L, F, K) of the MMPI shows a negative (-) slope?	Sophisticated defense	Naive but open attitude	Psychologically closed stance	Impaired defensive ability	A negative (-) slope indicates that the L, F, K scores are all low, which typically represents a normal response on the MMPI. Therefore, the possible interpretation in this case is a 'naive but open attitude.' This suggests that the individual has a naive and pure attitude towards others, but is also open to new experiences and ideas, and is curious.	The pattern of a negative (-) slope when connecting the three validity scale scores can indicate a 'naive but open attitude.' This pattern is seen in people on the MMPI who have high F-scale scores and low K-scale scores, indicating that they are socially naive and assertive, yet open-minded. These individuals do not hesitate to express their thoughts and feelings and are curious about new experiences. However, they may also worry about the impact their expressions may have on others and sometimes suppress or hide their emotions. While these personality traits may not pose a significant issue in everyday situations, they can lead to a defensive attitude when emotionally stressed or in complex situations, which can be problematic in certain contexts.	B
Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment method for behaviors that are not self-aware but are capable of communicating with others?	Introspection method	Questionnaire method	Task performance method	Observation method	When the individual is not aware of their own behavior, methods like the questionnaire or introspection are not suitable. Therefore, observing the behavior of others to understand what actions they are taking and communicating accordingly is the most appropriate assessment method. Hence, the correct answer is 'Observation method'.	When problematic behaviors are not self-aware to the client but can be easily identified during communication with others, the observation method, which involves directly observing the client's behavior to make a judgment, is most appropriate. Other assessment methods rely on the client's subjective self-report, so they are not suitable when the problematic behavior is not self-aware.	D
Which of the following descriptions about behavioral assessment methods is incorrect?	Participant observation is a method where the individual being observed is involved in a natural environment while being recorded.	Self-observation involves the individual collecting data on their interactions between themselves and the environment.	Analog observation is a method of observing in an unrestricted environment.	Naturalistic observation is a method where the observer records the behavior of participants within the environment without being a participant themselves.	Analog observation is a method of observing in a restricted environment.	The statement that analog observation is a method of observing in an unrestricted environment is incorrect. Analog observation involves creating an environment that is similar to the real situation to elicit certain behaviors and observing them within this controlled setting. Therefore, it is a method of observing in a restricted environment.	C
Which of the following is NOT included in J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) model?	retention	content	operation	product	'Retention' is not included in J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) model. It is related to memory, which is not considered a component of intelligence in this model. Guilford proposed 180 elements of intelligence, which included content, product, and operation.	The component 'retention' is not included in Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) model. Retention is related to memory, and Guilford did not classify it as a separate function within his model. Guilford's model is composed of content, product, and operation.	A
Which of the following is incorrect regarding the interpretive meaning of MMPI-2 code pairs?	3-8: Thinking may be essentially delusional.	1-2: Shows complaints and concerns about various physical symptoms.	4-9: Tendency towards acting out behaviors is high.	2-6: Often exhibits conversion symptoms.	The incorrect interpretive meaning for the 2-6 code pair is 'often exhibits conversion symptoms.' In fact, the 2-6 code pair indicates 'excessive worry and anxiety about physical symptoms.' Conversion symptoms are more commonly associated with the 3-4 code pair.	The interpretation that the 2-6 code pair often indicates conversion symptoms is incorrect. In reality, the 2-6 code pair tends to indicate excessive worry and anxiety about physical symptoms, insomnia, depression, and other psychological symptoms. Conversion symptoms refer to physical symptoms that appear as a response to everyday stress or emotional shock, which is a different concept.	D
In counseling interviews, what is the basic method where the counselor elaborates the client's expressed fundamental emotions, thoughts, and attitudes with different, fresh words?	Interpretation	Confrontation	Reflection	Active Listening	The technique where the counselor elaborates the client's expressed fundamental emotions, thoughts, and attitudes with different, fresh words is called 'reflection'. This technique helps the client to face their emotions and thoughts, to clarify them, and to interpret them.	Reflection is when the counselor listens to the client's emotions, thoughts, and attitudes and summarizes them in different words. Through this process, the client can verify that their feelings or thoughts have been properly conveyed to the counselor, and the counselor plays the role of reorganizing the client's words to aid their understanding. Through such a process, the client and counselor can facilitate smooth communication with each other.	C
What is the most appropriate primary role of a clinical psychologist as proposed by the Boulder model?	Therapy, Assessment, Consultation	Therapy, Assessment, Research	Therapy, Assessment, Administration	Assessment, Education, Administration	The Boulder model suggests that clinical psychologists primarily perform three roles. First, they provide therapy to patients. Second, they assess and diagnose patients' problems. Lastly, they conduct research in the field of clinical psychology. Therefore, 'Therapy, Assessment, Research' is the correct answer.	The Boulder model presents 'Therapy, Assessment, Research' as the primary roles of a clinical psychologist. This means that a clinical psychologist is not only responsible for diagnosing and treating patients but also for evaluating the effectiveness of treatments and developing new therapeutic methods through research. Therefore, 'Therapy, Assessment, Research' is the most appropriate answer. 'Consultation' is not included as a primary role, and while 'Administration' and 'Education' may be part of the roles, they are not the primary ones, making 'Therapy, Assessment, Research' the most fitting answer.	B
Which of the following descriptions about the structure of personality according to Freud is incorrect?	The superego develops during the process of toilet training in the anal stage.	The ego is considered the executive of personality and is included in cognitive abilities.	The id operates according to the pleasure principle.	The superego is the last system to develop among the structures of personality.	The superego is not related to the process of toilet training during the anal stage, but rather, it is more accurately described as developing from the relationship with the mother.	The superego has no relation to the process of toilet training during the anal stage, nor does it have anything to do with physical development. Therefore, the statement 'The superego develops during the process of toilet training in the anal stage' is incorrect. The superego is known to form through the internalization of a parent's values and norms during early childhood.	A
In transactional analysis counseling, what is it called when analyzing personality or a series of transactions from the perspective of the ego state model?	Transaction Pattern Analysis	Structural Analysis	Script Analysis	Functional Analysis	The ego state model is a model used to analyze an individual's personality and behavior. Therefore, in transactional analysis counseling, analyzing personality or a series of transactions from the perspective of the ego state model is called 'Structural Analysis'. Structural Analysis is a method of understanding an individual's personality structure and predicting behavior based on it.	Structural Analysis involves analyzing an individual's personality or a series of transactions from the perspective of the ego state model. This helps to understand the interaction between an individual's internal structure and external situations, aiding in problem-solving. Therefore, in transactional analysis counseling, analyzing personality or a series of transactions from the perspective of the ego state model is indeed Structural Analysis.	B
In person-centered therapy theory, which attitude is most appropriate for the therapist?	Unconditional reflection	Openness to experience	Analysis of resistance	Congruence	In person-centered therapy theory, 'congruence' refers to the therapist's attitude of being honest and transparent in communication with the patient. This plays an important role in building a trust relationship with the patient and making progress in the therapy process.	Person-centered therapy theory emphasizes the importance of the therapist maintaining congruence in the relationship with the patient. This means that the therapist expresses their own thoughts and feelings honestly to the patient, accepts and empathizes with the patient's opinions and feelings, thereby forming trust and intimacy with the patient and enhancing the effectiveness of the therapy. Therefore, 'congruence' is the most appropriate attitude.	D
In Clark's cognitive theory, what is the key factor that triggers panic attacks?	Learned helplessness in situations of panic attacks	Inadequate defense mechanisms in anxiety-provoking situations	Negative and dysfunctional beliefs about oneself	Catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations	In Clark's cognitive theory, the key factor that triggers panic attacks is identified as 'catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations.' This means that an individual negatively interprets their bodily sensations and mistakenly regards them as signs of a panic attack. For example, interpreting a fast heartbeat as a sign of anxiety, which then leads to increased anxiety and triggers a panic attack. This misinterpretation is one of the factors that can trigger panic attacks, along with negative and dysfunctional beliefs about oneself, learned helplessness in situations of panic attacks, and inadequate defense mechanisms in anxiety-provoking situations.	From a cognitive perspective in explaining panic disorder, the key factor that leads to panic attacks is 'catastrophic misinterpretation of bodily sensations.' This occurs when a patient misinterprets their bodily sensations and mistakenly perceives them as threatening situations. Such misinterpretations cause anxiety and fear, which can lead to panic attacks. For instance, if a patient feels their heart racing or has difficulty breathing, they may misinterpret these as symptoms of a serious heart condition or respiratory disease. These misinterpretations can trigger panic attacks, highlighting the need for accurate understanding and interpretation of bodily sensations.	D
A 23-month-old toddler has come in with the main symptoms of being small for their age, still not walking steadily, and being able to say only 'mommy' and 'daddy'. Which test would be appropriate for this toddler?	Infant Intelligence Test	Picture Intelligence Test	Denver Developmental Screening Test	Piagetian Intelligence Test	The Denver Developmental Screening Test is an assessment that evaluates the developmental status of a child, comprehensively assessing areas such as language, social interaction, and cognitive abilities. Given that this toddler has a limited vocabulary and is not walking steadily, a delay in language and motor development is suspected, making the Denver Developmental Screening Test suitable. The other tests are less relevant to the symptoms of this toddler or provide a narrower range of assessment compared to the Denver Developmental Screening Test.	Correct Answer: Denver Developmental Screening Test  Reason: The Denver Developmental Screening Test evaluates the developmental status of a child holistically, assessing various domains such as language, social interaction, and cognitive abilities. Since this toddler is not walking steadily and has a limited vocabulary, the Denver Developmental Screening Test, which can focus on assessing language and motor development areas, is appropriate. The Picture Intelligence Test assesses visual intelligence, and the Infant Intelligence Test and Piagetian Intelligence Test are generally aimed at older children rather than very young toddlers.	C
Which of the following is NOT an element that can be identified by a functional analysis of the current problem in behavior therapy?	Organismic variables related to the problem behavior	Consequences of the problem behavior	Stimuli or antecedent conditions that elicit the problem behavior	Cognitive interpretations related to the problem behavior	Cognitive interpretations related to the problem behavior are not the cause of the current problem but can lead to problem behavior depending on the individual's cognitive interpretation, so they are not an element that can be identified in a functional analysis.	Cognitive interpretations related to the problem behavior are not the cause of the current problem but can lead to problem behavior depending on the individual's cognitive interpretation, and therefore are not an element that can be identified in a functional analysis. The other options are causes or variables related to the problem behavior and play an important role in functional analysis.	D
What is the key element of systematic desensitization?	Interpretation	Empathy	Relaxation	Cognitive restructuring	The key element of systematic desensitization is 'Relaxation'. This involves helping the patient to feel at ease and express their emotions in order to reduce emotional distress. Relaxation helps the patient to unwind and reduce anxiety and stress, which plays an important role in building a trusting relationship between the patient and the counselor.	The key element of systematic desensitization is relaxation. Relaxation eases emotional tension, and while understanding and empathizing with the other person's emotions is important, it is even more crucial to alleviate their tension through relaxation. When the other person's tension is relieved through relaxation, they can focus more and continue the conversation in a more cooperative manner. Therefore, relaxation is one of the key elements in systematic desensitization.	C
Which of the following is NOT a consideration when using punishment?	Flexibility	Intensity	Immediacy	Consistency	When using punishment, the considerations should include intensity, consistency, and immediacy. These are necessary elements to maximize the effectiveness of punishment. However, flexibility refers to the ability to adjust the scope or degree of punishment, which is not a consideration when applying punishment. While flexibility can be applied depending on the situation, intensity, consistency, and immediacy are more important for maximizing the effectiveness of punishment.	Correct Answer: Flexibility. Explanation: When using punishment, it is important to consider intensity, consistency, and immediacy. Intensity refers to ensuring the punishment is appropriately severe, consistency means applying the same punishment in similar situations, and immediacy indicates that the punishment should occur immediately. Flexibility refers to the ability to adjust the severity or type of punishment depending on the situation. Therefore, while flexibility is important, it is relatively less critical compared to the other three elements.	A
Which ethical principle presented by Kitchener refers to the behavior of a counselor in keeping promises made to clients and providing trust and reliability?	fidelity	autonomy	justice/fairness	beneficence	Fidelity means that the counselor keeps promises made to clients and acts in a way that provides trust and reliability. Therefore, this ethical principle plays an important role in ensuring the counselor's credibility and the client's safety.	Fidelity, one of the basic ethical principles of counseling presented by Kitchener, means that the counselor keeps promises made to clients and acts in a way that provides trust and reliability. Counselors must keep the promises made in their relationships with clients to gain their trust and must act with the clients' best interests as a priority. Therefore, the behavior of a counselor in keeping promises made to clients and providing trust and reliability is in accordance with the principle of fidelity.	A
Which of the following disorders is NOT included in sexual dysfunction?	Female orgasmic disorder	Erectile disorder	Frictional arrival disorder	Delayed ejaculation	The term 'frictional arrival disorder' does not correspond to any recognized sexual dysfunction. It appears to be a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of a term. Recognized sexual dysfunctions include disorders related to sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain during intercourse.	The term 'frictional arrival disorder' is not found in clinical or medical literature related to sexual dysfunctions. Sexual dysfunctions are typically categorized into issues with sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, or pain during sexual activity. Since 'frictional arrival disorder' is not a recognized term, it does not fall under the category of sexual dysfunction.	C
Which of the following is NOT considered a basic need in Glasser's Choice Theory of counseling?	The need for self-esteem	The need for survival	The need for power	The need for fun	In Glasser's Choice Theory, the need for self-esteem is not considered a basic need. This is because Glasser identified the basic human needs as survival, love and belonging, freedom, and fun, viewing self-esteem as a byproduct of fulfilling these needs. Therefore, self-esteem is seen as an outcome of need satisfaction, rather than a need itself.	Glasser's Choice Theory does not assume the need for self-esteem. Instead, it posits the needs for survival, power, and fun. This emphasizes that individuals should control their behavior and take responsibility, striving to satisfy their own needs. Thus, the need for self-esteem remains an internal challenge for the individual, and the counselor's role is to help the individual recognize their needs and find ways to fulfill them.	A
In Erikson's stages of development, what is the crisis or task that characterizes old age in the final, 8th stage?	Industry vs. Inferiority	Integrity vs. Despair	Intimacy vs. Isolation	Generativity vs. Stagnation	In old age, individuals reflect on their lives and the relationships with significant others. It is important to integrate past experiences and feel satisfaction with one's life. However, during this process, feelings of regret or dissatisfaction may arise, leading to despair. Therefore, feeling integrity is crucial in this stage, as it helps to enhance satisfaction with one's life.	In the final 8th stage, which is old age, it is important to look back on one's entire life, integrate it, and establish a sense of existence. During this stage, individuals evaluate their lives based on past experiences and feel whether their life has been meaningful. In this process, one may feel despair if they are unable to integrate their life and feel that they have lived an unsatisfactory life. Thus, it is important to integrate one's life and establish a sense of existence, feeling integrity. Therefore, 'Integrity vs. Despair' is the correct answer.	B
Which is a paper-and-pencil test consisting of 24 geometric shapes used as a developmental test for visual-motor integration in children?	VMI	CPT	CBCL	BGT	VMI is one of the assessment tools used to test children's visual-motor integration abilities. It evaluates a child's visual perception and the coordination between hand, eye, and brain through a paper-and-pencil test consisting of 24 geometric shapes. Therefore, VMI is one of the tools for testing visual-motor integration abilities. BGT is the Bender Gestalt Test, CPT is the Continuous Performance Test, and CBCL is the Child Behavior Checklist.	VMI stands for 'Visual-Motor Integration,' which is a tool used to assess visual-motor integration abilities. It evaluates how well a child's visual perception and motor skills work together through a paper-and-pencil test where they draw 24 geometric shapes. Therefore, VMI is the correct answer. BGT stands for 'Bender Gestalt Test,' CPT stands for 'Continuous Performance Test,' and CBCL stands for 'Child Behavior Checklist,' all of which are different types of developmental assessments or behavioral evaluation tools.	A
Which behavior modification technique in the treatment of social phobia involves confronting situations that have been avoided rather than continuing to avoid them?	Cognitive restructuring training for dysfunctional beliefs	Role-playing	Cognitive restructuring training for automatic thoughts	Exposure therapy	Exposure therapy is one of the behavioral therapy techniques used in the treatment of social phobia, which involves facing anxiety-provoking situations without avoidance and learning coping strategies. This helps to reduce anxiety and build confidence, enabling better handling of social situations.	Exposure therapy is one of the most commonly used behavior modification techniques in the treatment of social phobia. It involves making the patient confront situations they fear and have been avoiding, with the goal of no longer feeling fear in those situations. Through this process, patients can overcome their fears and regain confidence.	D
Which theory of career counseling aims to avoid special diagnoses and helps to clarify the concept of self within one's professional role?	Behaviorist career counseling	Client-centered career counseling	Psychodynamic career counseling	Trait-factor career counseling	Client-centered career counseling aims to clarify and enact the concept of self within one's professional role and to help in this process. It avoids special diagnoses and focuses on the client's experiences and perspectives. Therefore, counseling is based on understanding the client's concept of self and professional role, and it is characterized by helping the client to solve problems on their own.	Client-centered career counseling is distinguished from other theories by its focus on the client's self-concept and values in career counseling. The goal is to clarify the client's self-concept and to help them enact their professional roles accordingly. Theoretically, it is connected to Carl Rogers' humanistic psychology theory, which respects the client's self-concept and aims to help the client solve problems independently. Therefore, client-centered career counseling, which avoids special diagnoses and centers on the client's self-concept, is the correct answer.	B
Which reinforcement schedule shows the slowest learning rate but the highest response rate (and is the most resistant to extinction)?	Fixed ratio reinforcement schedule	Variable interval reinforcement schedule	Variable ratio reinforcement schedule	Fixed interval reinforcement schedule	The variable ratio reinforcement schedule is the most resistant to extinction because it maintains a certain ratio of reinforcement, which means that the costs that were proportional to the previous ratio increase, making it more difficult to accept.	The variable ratio reinforcement schedule, despite a slower learning rate, shows the highest response rate among reinforcement schedules. This is because the amount of reward varies with the progress of learning, so the more effort the learner puts in, the more reward they can receive. As a result, learners are motivated to work harder to receive rewards, making extinction more difficult.	C
Which area is difficult to assess with the Basic Learning Skills Test, a type of achievement test?	Reading comprehension	Calculation ability	Spelling ability	Spatial reasoning ability	The Basic Learning Skills Test evaluates language, arithmetic, and cognitive abilities, among which spatial reasoning ability is difficult to assess because it involves many visual elements. This is because there can be differences depending on an individual's visual ability and experience. Therefore, it is advisable to use other assessment tools in conjunction with this area.	The Basic Learning Skills Test evaluates cognitive areas, and among these, spatial reasoning ability is a challenging area to assess. This ability involves understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships, using visual information to solve problems. Such ability is not frequently used in everyday life, which is why it is classified as a difficult area to assess.	D
Which therapeutic approach and stance is different from the one based on cognitive determinism?	Cognitive Therapy	Rational Emotive Therapy	Self-Instructional Training	Progressive Relaxation Training	Cognitive determinism is the theory that human behavior is determined by cognitive processes. Therapeutic approaches and stances based on this theory focus on human cognitive processes. Rational Emotive Therapy aims to change negative thoughts and emotions into positive ones. Cognitive Therapy aims to modify negative thoughts and beliefs into positive thoughts and beliefs. Self-Instructional Training aims to observe and regulate one's thoughts and emotions. Progressive Relaxation Training aims to relieve muscle tension. Through this, it seeks to alleviate physical tension and stress, and to find mental peace. This is a slightly different approach from cognitive determinism, focusing on treating physical responses.	Progressive Relaxation Training is a therapeutic approach that relaxes the mind through physical relaxation, but cognitive determinism starts from the position that human judgment and decisions are made through cognitive processes, pursuing therapeutic approaches such as Cognitive Therapy, Rational Emotive Therapy, and Self-Instructional Training. Therefore, Progressive Relaxation Training is a different therapeutic approach from cognitive determinism. Progressive Relaxation Training is a therapeutic approach that releases physical tension through techniques such as muscle relaxation, breath control, and visualization. This helps to simultaneously ease tension in both the mind and body, and to regulate emotions such as stress and anxiety. For example, using muscle relaxation techniques can release muscle tension, which in turn relaxes the mind. This helps to simultaneously ease tension in both the mind and body, and to regulate emotions such as stress and anxiety.	D
The DSM-IV divides personality disorders into several clusters. Which of the following does not belong to the cluster characterized by dramatic, emotional, erratic, and impulsive behavior?	Narcissistic Personality Disorder	Histrionic Personality Disorder	Antisocial Personality Disorder	Dependent Personality Disorder	Dependent Personality Disorder does not fall into the cluster characterized by dramatic, emotional, erratic, and impulsive behavior. This is because it tends to involve a reliance on others and a reluctance to express one's own thoughts and feelings, preferring to comply with the wishes of others.	In DSM-IV, personality disorders are divided into three clusters, and the cluster characterized by dramatic, emotional, erratic, and impulsive behavior includes 'Histrionic Personality Disorder.' On the other hand, 'Dependent Personality Disorder' is characterized by a tendency to rely on others for judgment and to be dependent on them, to undervalue oneself, and to excessively admire others. Therefore, this disorder does not belong to the cluster characterized by dramatic, emotional, erratic, and impulsive behavior.	D
Which of the following is a correct explanation regarding the cause of depressive disorders?	It is related to hyperthyroidism.	It is related to an excess of vitamin B1, B6, and folic acid.	It is related to a deficiency of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin.	It is related to a decrease in cortisol secretion.	The neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin are known to be one of the causes of depression. A deficiency in these two substances can lead to symptoms of depression.	One of the causes of depressive disorders is related to a deficiency of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. These two neurotransmitters are related to mood regulation, and a deficiency can result in depressive symptoms.	C
What is the most appropriate effective group intervention for patients diagnosed with diseases such as cancer and diabetes?	Family therapy	Psychodynamic group therapy	Psychoeducational group therapy	Humanistic group therapy	Patients with chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes need not only physical treatment but also psychological support. Among the forms of group interventions for these patients, psychoeducational group therapy is the most effective. This is because it allows patients to increase their understanding of their condition, acquire appropriate self-management methods, and gain psychological stability through the process of sharing and supporting each other's experiences. Additionally, such group therapy strengthens patients' social support networks and increases adherence to treatment.	Diseases like cancer and diabetes involve not only physical treatment but also significant psychological components. Therefore, group interventions targeting these patients should focus on psychological aspects. Among these, psychoeducational group therapy can be particularly effective as it enables patients to enhance their understanding of their illness, learn proactive coping methods, and provide support to each other by sharing experiences. Thus, for patients diagnosed with diseases such as cancer and diabetes, psychoeducational group therapy is the most suitable form of effective group intervention.	C
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) compared to the MMPI-2?	It has fewer items.	It has fewer clinical scales.	It includes interpersonal scales in addition to clinical scales.	It uses a four-choice format.	The Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) includes interpersonal scales in addition to clinical scales and uses a four-choice format, but the number of items is similar, and it has more clinical scales than the MMPI. Therefore, 'It has fewer clinical scales.' is not a correct description.	The Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) includes interpersonal scales in addition to clinical scales and uses a four-choice format. Therefore, 'It has fewer clinical scales.' is not a correct description. In fact, the PAI contains more clinical scales than the MMPI-2.	B
In Holland's theory of personality, what does it mean when an individual works and lives in an environment that is identical or similar to their personality type?	Identity	Consistency	Congruence	Measurement	Congruence refers to the situation where an individual works and lives in an environment that matches or is similar to their personality type. It implies that a person can lead a happier and more satisfying life when their personality and environment are in alignment. This is an important factor in preventing the stress and dissatisfaction that can occur when there is a mismatch between a person's personality and their environment.	Congruence is the concept that an individual can lead a happier and more satisfying life when they are in an environment that matches their personality type. It means that working and living in a job or environment that aligns with one's personality, interests, and abilities can lead to a more efficient and satisfying life. Therefore, congruence is one of the important elements that can enhance the quality of an individual's life.	C
Which scale of the MMPI clinical scales measures the hypochondriacal pattern of having excessive and pervasive concern about one's physical functioning and health?	Hysteria Scale (Hy)	Paranoia Scale (Pa)	Hypochondriasis Scale (Hs)	Depression Scale (D)	The Hypochondriasis Scale (Hs) measures the hypochondriacal pattern, which includes excessive worry and anxiety about health, and excessive concern about physical symptoms. Therefore, this scale can be used to determine if an individual has excessive worries about their health.	The Hypochondriasis Scale (Hs) is a measure of hypochondriacal patterns, where individuals who have excessive and pervasive concern about their physical functioning and health receive high scores. Therefore, this scale is the correct answer. The Depression Scale (D) measures depressive patterns, the Hysteria Scale (Hy) measures emotionally over-sensitive and exaggerated responses, and the Paranoia Scale (Pa) measures patterns of social maladjustment.	C
Which of the following is a correct description of the psychological and social characteristics of gambling addiction?	Gamblers work harder than others at their jobs to secure funds for gambling.	They refuse to acknowledge their gambling problem and tend to make excuses.	As a psychological characteristic, they pursue long-term satisfaction rather than short-term gratification.	Gamblers are generally obsessed only with gambling and do not have other personal issues.	The correct description is that gamblers refuse to acknowledge their gambling problem and tend to make excuses. This is because gamblers tend to justify and excuse themselves rather than recognizing and resolving their gambling issues. Such an attitude prevents gamblers from going through the first necessary steps of treatment or recovery, which are recognizing and acknowledging the problem, making treatment or recovery more difficult.	Gamblers do not only obsess over gambling but also have other personal issues. They do not work harder at their jobs to secure funds for gambling; instead, they waste time and energy being consumed by gambling. Additionally, gamblers tend to pursue short-term gratification. Lastly, the fact that they refuse to acknowledge their gambling behavior and tend to make excuses indicates that gamblers find it difficult to recognize and accept their problems.	B
Which of the following is NOT a strategy for improving adolescents' self-concept in counseling?	Awareness of their own abilities and significance	Interpersonal skills	Self-understanding and expressive abilities	Nationalism and cultural superiority	Nationalism and cultural superiority are not strategies for enhancing adolescents' self-concept. This attitude involves demeaning other countries or cultures while elevating one's own, which excludes diversity and mutual respect. It can have a negative impact on the growth and development of adolescents. Therefore, it is important in counseling to emphasize diversity and mutual respect and to avoid nationalism and cultural superiority.	Among the strategies for enhancing self-concept, 'nationalism and cultural superiority' is not one because it can negatively shape an adolescent's self-concept. It can lead to the belief that one's own country or culture is superior to others, which can diminish one's own value and lead to attitudes of exclusion or discrimination against others. Therefore, instead of inducing such attitudes, strategies that improve awareness of one's abilities and importance, interpersonal skills, self-understanding, and expressive abilities are necessary.	D
Among Satir's communication models, which one involves ignoring one's own stress and giving power to others while agreeing with everyone when dealing with stress?	Super-reasonable	Irrelevant	Placating	Congruent	The placating style is a way of communicating where one ignores their own stress to alleviate the stress of others, agrees with others, and gives away power. Therefore, in this situation, ignoring one's own stress and agreeing with others while giving away power corresponds to the placating style.	The correct answer is 'Placating.' The reason is that in Satir's communication model, the type that ignores one's own stress and gives power to others while agreeing with everyone when dealing with stress is precisely the placating style. The placating style involves accepting and agreeing with the conversation partner's opinions and influencing their heart to accept one's own opinions. This method helps minimize conflict with the conversation partner and maintain a cooperative relationship.	C
Which psychological test is most suitable for assessing the patterns and levels of daily living functions in the elderly population?	K-VMI-6	K-WAIS-IV	MMPI-2	K-Vineland-II	The K-Vineland-II is an assessment tool for evaluating daily living functions in the elderly population, including those over the age of 80. It can assess various areas such as cognition, socialization, and daily living skills. Therefore, this tool is suitable for assessing the psychological state of the elderly over 80 years old. The K-WAIS and K-WAIS-IV are intelligence tests, and SMS is a socialization assessment tool.	The K-Vineland-II is a psychological test designed to assess daily living functions, making it most suitable for evaluating the patterns and levels of daily living functions in the elderly population. It evaluates the necessary functions for daily life, including areas such as cognition, socialization, communication, and daily living skills. Therefore, for the assessment of daily living functions in the elderly population, using the K-Vineland-II is appropriate.	D
Which of the following is a correct description of a behavioral assessment scale?	The attribute to be assessed must be clearly defined.	There is a tendency to rate extreme scores for each item.	It is difficult for the halo effect to take place.	It is suitable for assessing implicit or inferred aspects of personality.	Behavioral assessment scales are suitable for assessing implicit or inferred aspects of personality, and they have the characteristic of being less susceptible to the halo effect. However, there is a tendency to rate extreme scores for each item, so it is important to clearly define the attribute you want to assess. This plays an important role in increasing the accuracy and reliability of the assessment results.	Behavioral assessment scales are tools used to evaluate specific behaviors or personality traits. If the attribute to be assessed is not clearly defined, the results of the assessment can be inaccurate or inconsistent. Therefore, it is very important to clearly define the attribute you want to assess. The fact that it is difficult for the halo effect to take place means that the evaluator's preferences or prejudices do not influence the assessment results. Being suitable for assessing implicit or inferred aspects of personality means that it is appropriate for evaluating internal personality traits or inferred characteristics. Lastly, the tendency to rate extreme scores for each item means that the evaluator may give excessively positive or negative ratings for certain items.	A
What learning principle is the basis of systematic desensitization?	Classical conditioning	Higher-order conditioning	Aversion conditioning	Operant conditioning	Systematic desensitization is based on the principles of classical conditioning. This principle states that when two stimuli are repeatedly presented together, one of the stimuli will become associated with the other and elicit a response. In systematic desensitization, the goal is to reduce anxiety by associating an anxiety-provoking stimulus with a positive response such as muscle relaxation.	Systematic desensitization is founded on the principles of classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is a learning principle where a natural connection is formed between a stimulus and a response, such that when two stimuli are presented at the same time, a connection between these stimuli is formed. In systematic desensitization, the aim is to reduce anxiety by controlling the stimulus that is presented along with the anxiety-inducing stimulus. Through this process, as the anxiety decreases, desensitization to the anxiety-provoking stimulus develops.	A
Among juvenile delinquencies, which one is impulsive and opportunistic, and once it occurs, it can be repeated and become habitual, potentially combining with other delinquent behaviors?	Internet addiction	Violence	Drug use	Kleptomania	Among juvenile delinquencies, impulsive and opportunistic behaviors can become repetitive and habitual once they occur. These behaviors can combine with other delinquent behaviors, and among them, 'kleptomania' has a high likelihood of combining with other delinquent behaviors. This is because adolescents may feel socially isolated and lonely, and they may repeat and develop a habit of stealing as a way to cope with these feelings.	Among juvenile delinquencies, impulsive and opportunistic behaviors can become repetitive and habitual once they occur, and they can combine with other delinquent behaviors. Among these, 'kleptomania' has a high likelihood of combining with other delinquent behaviors. This is because adolescents may find it difficult to adapt socially, making it hard for them to form social relationships. Therefore, kleptomania has a high likelihood of appearing alongside other delinquent behaviors.	D
Which of the following is the least related to the method of sampling a normative group from a population?	Simple random sampling	Ratio sampling	Cluster sampling	Stratified sampling	Ratio sampling is not the correct answer because it involves selecting a normative group from the population by considering the proportion of each group within the population. This method can more accurately reflect the characteristics of the population and determine the size of the sample more efficiently. Therefore, it is not the method that is furthest from sampling a normative group from a population.	Ratio sampling is a method of selecting a normative group from the population by considering the specific attributes (e.g., age, gender, income, etc.) of each member and their proportions within the population. This method has the advantage of increasing the likelihood that the members of the normative group will represent the specific attributes of the population, thereby increasing the representativeness of the sample. Therefore, ratio sampling is not the method that is least related to sampling a normative group from a population; rather, it is one of the methods that can enhance representativeness.	B
According to Freud, which element of personality is formed in the process of overcoming castration anxiety?	Superego	Ego	Id	Unconscious	Freud believed that the superego is formed in the process of overcoming castration anxiety. The superego internalizes the norms and values received from parents or other significant people during one's childhood, interacts with the ego, and plays an important role in personality development. The superego represents the ideal version of oneself and helps regulate and balance the conflicts between the ego and the id.	Freud divided the human psyche into three parts: the 'id', 'ego', and 'superego'. The element of personality that is formed in the process of overcoming castration anxiety is the 'superego'. The superego is formed by internalizing the norms and values of one's parents during childhood, and it is responsible for conscience and moral values. Therefore, the superego plays a crucial role in overcoming castration anxiety and in the formation of the ego.	A
Among the new areas of specialization for clinical psychologists, which is most closely related to obesity and stress management?	Child Clinical Psychology	Health Psychology	Neuropsychology	Forensic Psychology	Health psychology is the field of study that researches the psychological impact on human health and disease, as well as the methods for prevention, treatment, and management. Therefore, it is closely associated with health issues such as obesity and stress management, and is considered a related area of specialization.	Obesity and stress are closely related to health, and health psychology is the field of study that researches human health and disease, health maintenance and recovery, and health promotion. Therefore, the area most closely related to obesity and stress management is health psychology. Hence, the correct answer is 'Health Psychology'.	B
Which defense mechanism described by Freud involves transforming sexual or aggressive impulses into socially acceptable, admirable directions?	Rationalization	Displacement	Sublimation	Consciousness	Sublimation is the defense mechanism that involves transforming sexual or aggressive impulses into socially acceptable, admirable directions. It is about accepting one's desires or impulses in a positive way, which makes it easier to justify one's behavior and to accept criticism from others. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Sublimation'.	Sublimation is a defense mechanism that transforms sexual or aggressive impulses into socially acceptable, admirable directions. It involves changing one's desires or impulses in a positive direction to protect oneself and to turn them into socially acceptable behaviors. For example, transforming sexual impulses into other creative activities or resolving aggressive impulses through conversation or negotiation. Such defense mechanisms can help with an individual's mental stability and social adaptation.	C
What is the appropriate number of members for an interactive therapeutic group as suggested by Yalom?	4-5 members	7-8 members	10-11 members	12-13 members	Yalom suggested that 7-8 members are appropriate for an interactive therapeutic group. This is because too few members can lead to insufficient interaction within the group, and too many members can limit the opportunity for each individual to speak, making interaction difficult. Therefore, 7-8 members is the appropriate number.	Yalom suggested that 7-8 members are appropriate for an interactive therapeutic group. This is because if the group is composed of too few or too many members, the interaction within the group may not be smooth, which can reduce the therapeutic effect. Additionally, a group size of 7-8 members allows for a variety of backgrounds and experiences among the members, enabling a range of perspectives and opinions to be presented. This fosters active dialogue and interaction within the group, and provides opportunities for each member to share personal experiences and empathize with others.	B
Which of the following statements about sensation-seeking tendencies is correct?	It is presented as evidence to refute the claim that personality traits are partially genetically inherited.	There is a claim that the higher the sensation-seeking tendency, the lower the level of arousal in the system that controls the neurotransmitter called norepinephrine (NE).	It is used as a physiological criterion to distinguish between introversion and extraversion.	Eysenck created a scale for measuring sensation-seeking tendencies.	There is a claim that the higher the sensation-seeking tendency, the lower the level of arousal in the system that controls the neurotransmitter called norepinephrine (NE). This means that people with high sensation-seeking tendencies seek more stimulation while their brain's ability to process stimulation is reduced, leading them to need more stimulation. This can be presented as evidence to refute the claim that personality traits are partially genetically inherited.	The claim that the higher the sensation-seeking tendency, the lower the level of arousal in the system that controls the neurotransmitter called norepinephrine (NE) suggests that people with high sensation-seeking tendencies might be expected to secrete more NE due to seeking more risks and thrills. However, the actual situation is not as expected. This is because people with high sensation-seeking tendencies are already experiencing higher levels of arousal, so they do not need an increased secretion of neurotransmitters like NE to feel sufficient stimulation.	B
What is the treatment technique called where a patient with alcohol addiction is given medication that induces vomiting when they consume alcohol?	Relaxation training	Self-expression training	Aversion therapy	Behavior reinforcement	This technique is called 'aversion therapy,' which involves administering a drug that causes vomiting when the alcohol-dependent patient consumes alcohol, thereby inducing a sense of disgust towards drinking alcohol, with the aim of reducing or eliminating the behavior of drinking.	The treatment technique for alcohol addiction patients that involves administering medication that induces vomiting when they consume alcohol is called 'aversion therapy.' This therapy aims to create a sense of aversion to alcohol, making the patient reluctant to drink and helping them overcome alcohol addiction.	C
Adolescence, which transitions from childhood to adulthood, begins with puberty. Which of the following developmental characteristics that appear during this time is incorrect?	Secondary sexual characteristics develop.	There is a lot of psychosocial pressure in the process of becoming an adult.	The rate of each physical change shows a gradual growth.	They choose friends of the same and opposite sex.	The statement that the rate of each physical change shows a gradual growth is incorrect because, in the early stages of puberty, bones and muscles grow rapidly, which also leads to a proportional increase in body weight. However, later on, the growth rate of bones and muscles slows down, and so does the rate of weight gain. This can be understood as a process where the growth rate slows down and the body shape stabilizes.	The statement that the rate of each physical change shows a gradual growth is incorrect. Puberty is a period of very rapid physical, emotional, and cognitive changes, and the rate of each physical change also changes significantly. For example, the size of hands and feet grows quickly, and the proportion between the face and the torso changes. These changes play an important role in the transition from adolescence to adulthood, as this is the period when growth is at its fastest.	C
In group counseling, what is the intervention method where you directly tell the other person about the reaction their behavior causes in you?	Modeling behavior	Experimenting with new behavior	Exchanging feedback	Self-disclosure and participation	Exchanging feedback is an intervention method where you directly tell the other person about your reaction to their behavior. Through this, the other person can understand the impact of their behavior, and you can accurately convey your reaction to their behavior. This facilitates interaction and helps improve the relationship between you and the other person. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is 'Exchanging feedback'.	In group counseling, exchanging feedback is an important element that enhances understanding between participants and aids in problem-solving by directly conveying one's reaction to the behavior of others, and vice versa. Through this process, the other person becomes aware of the impact of their behavior, and you can increase your understanding of their behavior. Therefore, exchanging feedback is one of the essential elements in group counseling.	C
Which of the following is NOT one of the three therapist conditions proposed by Rogers to facilitate positive change in clients?	Unconditional positive regard	Genuineness	Accurate empathy	Creativity	Creativity is not one of the three therapist conditions because it is not a quality or ability of the therapist, but rather something that clients can exhibit during the therapeutic process. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Creativity'.	Creativity is not one of the three conditions proposed by Rogers to facilitate positive change in clients. The reason is that creativity is not a condition of the therapist, but rather a personal characteristic that can vary widely depending on the therapist's abilities and experience. Therefore, 'Creativity' was not proposed as one of the three conditions for therapists to facilitate positive change in clients.	D
Which of the following is a correct description of the depressogenic attribution phenomenon that can cause depression?	Attributing the cause of success to external, stable, and specific factors.	Attributing the cause of failure to internal, stable, and global factors.	Attributing the cause of failure to external, stable, and specific factors.	Attributing the cause of success to internal, stable, and specific factors.	The depressogenic attribution phenomenon refers to attributing the cause of failure to internal, stable, and global factors. This means explaining one's own failures due to lack of ability or personal flaws as internal factors and believing that such failures will continue in the future. This way of thinking plays a significant role in causing depression.	The depressogenic attribution phenomenon, which can cause depression, involves attributing the cause of failure to internal, stable, and global factors. In other words, individuals with depression interpret their failures as internal problems, believe that these failures will persist stably, and affect all areas of their lives, which can lead to depression. Conversely, the cause of success is attributed to external, stable, and specific factors.	B
Which of the following statements about kleptomania is incorrect?	Repeatedly fails to resist impulses to steal items that are not needed for personal use or monetary value.	Steals out of anger or vengeance.	Experiences heightened tension before stealing.	Feels pleasure, gratification, or relief after stealing.	Stealing out of anger or vengeance is not a description of kleptomania but rather a motive for criminal behavior. Therefore, this is the incorrect statement.	Stealing out of anger or vengeance is not a description of kleptomania but rather one of the motives for criminal behavior. Kleptomania is characterized by a repeated failure to resist impulses to steal items that are not needed for personal use or monetary value, experiencing heightened tension before stealing, and feeling pleasure, gratification, or relief after stealing.	B
Which communication technique is used not only to help the patient articulate their message but also to ensure that the interviewer understands that message?	Confrontation	Summarization	Clarification	Elaboration	Correct answer: Clarification. Explanation: Clarification is one of the important communication techniques in patient interaction. This technique helps the patient to convey their message more clearly and ensures that the interviewer understands the message. To achieve this, the interviewer may summarize the patient's words, ask for elaboration, or confront to facilitate clear communication.	The correct answer is 'Clarification'. The reason is that in communication between a patient and a clinician, it is essential for the patient to clearly convey their situation and symptoms, and for the clinician to understand them in order to provide appropriate diagnosis and treatment. However, sometimes a patient may not be able to properly convey their situation, or the clinician may not understand it. In such cases, the clarification technique helps both the patient and the clinician to understand each other's messages clearly. Through this, the clinician can accurately understand the patient's situation, and the patient can clearly convey their circumstances.	C
Which of the following is least relevant when considering a neuropsychological assessment?	Age	Educational level	Gender	Time since injury	Gender is the least relevant because biological differences do not significantly affect neuropsychological characteristics. In contrast, time since injury, educational level, and age are all factors that influence neuropsychological characteristics and should be considered.	Gender is not significantly related to an individual's neuropsychological characteristics, making it the least relevant factor to consider during an assessment. The other options are directly associated with an individual's experiences, education, and age, which can influence their neuropsychological characteristics. However, aside from biological differences, gender does not have a significant connection to an individual's neuropsychological characteristics. Therefore, gender is a factor that is least relevant to consider during an assessment.	C
Which assessment method considers factors such as the antecedents of problem behavior, environmental incentives, alternative sources of reward, and attribution styles as important when evaluating a client?	Multiaxial classification system assessment	Psychodynamic assessment	Skill-oriented assessment	Cognitive-behavioral assessment	Cognitive-behavioral assessment takes into account the antecedents of problem behavior, environmental incentives, alternative sources of reward, and attribution styles to evaluate a client's problem behavior. Therefore, this method has the advantage of being able to assess the client's problem behavior ganzfeld-like, considering various factors, which allows for an accurate assessment.	Cognitive-behavioral assessment is a method that evaluates the causes of problem behavior and the ability to cope with it. It emphasizes factors such as the antecedents of problem behavior, environmental incentives, alternative sources of reward, and attribution styles, and identifies these to establish intervention strategies. In contrast, skill-oriented assessment focuses on evaluating an individual's technical abilities, psychodynamic assessment evaluates an individual's emotional, cognitive, and personality states, and multiaxial classification system assessment evaluates an individual's functioning levels across various domains.	D
In the MMPI, which clinical scale involves the statistical manipulation of K score correction to enhance the test's reliability and validity?	Si scale	Pt scale	D scale	L scale	K score correction is a method used in the MMPI to identify individuals with certain response patterns. This method is used to increase the reliability and validity of the test. The Pt scale is one of the clinical scales of the MMPI that includes K score correction. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Pt scale'.	The scale that adds the K correction score is the 'Pt scale'. This scale targets patients who tend to experience psychological problems, and by adding the K correction score, it serves to enhance the test's reliability and validity. The Pt scale measures emotional distress, depression, dissatisfaction, etc., and is used to assess the mental state of the patient.	B
Which of the following is NOT a typical personality change in old age?	Increased fear of change.	Increased introversion and passivity.	Decreased confidence in control.	Increased flexibility and openness of thought.	Increased flexibility and openness of thought is the least related option. Generally, in old age, cognitive abilities decline, and curiosity about new things decreases. However, some elderly people maintain flexibility and openness based on their experience and knowledge, allowing them to learn and apply new things. This shows that growth and development are possible even in old age.	The correct answer is 'Increased flexibility and openness of thought.' Contrary to common belief, there is a tendency for increased cognitive flexibility and openness in old age. This is because, in old age, knowledge and experience are accumulated, which can enhance the ability to accept new ideas or perspectives. Additionally, as older adults often have more time and freedom, they have more opportunities to discover new hobbies or interests and gain new experiences. Therefore, increased cognitive flexibility and openness are among the typical personality changes in old age.	D
What is a representative method for measuring the lateralization effect of the brain?	Wechsler Memory Scale	Personality Test	Maze Test	Dichotic Listening Technique	The Dichotic Listening Technique is a method that explores the lateralization effect of the brain by presenting different sounds to each ear. This method utilizes the characteristic of brain lateralization where sounds presented to the left ear are processed in the right hemisphere, and sounds presented to the right ear are processed in the left hemisphere. Therefore, the Dichotic Listening Technique is chosen as a method for investigating the lateralization effect of the brain.	One of the representative methods for measuring the lateralization effect of the brain is the Dichotic Listening Technique. This method involves presenting different sounds to each ear to measure the processing abilities of each hemisphere of the brain. Through this, it is possible to determine whether one hemisphere processes information faster than the other, or if one hemisphere has a higher level of processing ability.	D
What is the phenomenon where an extinguished response reappears after a period of rest?	Discrimination conditioning	Higher-order conditioning	Spontaneous recovery	Stimulus generalization	Spontaneous recovery refers to the phenomenon where a response that has been extinguished through conditioning or training temporarily disappears, but then reappears after a certain period without training or conditioning. This occurs because the response has not been completely extinguished, and it is different from stimulus generalization or conditioning.	Spontaneous recovery is the phenomenon where previously learned material reemerges after a certain period without training, even though the conditioning or training was temporarily extinguished. This happens because the learned material is stored in long-term memory. Therefore, the phenomenon where an extinguished response reappears after a period of rest is called spontaneous recovery.	C
Compared to projective personality tests, what is the advantage of objective personality tests?	Responses to unconscious content	Diversity of responses	Increased objectivity	Difficulty in defense	Objective personality tests are designed to consider the diversity of responses, unlike projective personality tests, which can vary depending on specific situations or environments. This increases objectivity, which in turn enhances the reliability of the test results and reduces the difficulty in defense, minimizing the responses to unconscious content.	Objective personality tests are considered to have high objectivity because they assess an individual's general personality traits rather than responses to specific situations or environments. This means that compared to projective personality tests, there is less diversity of responses, difficulty in defense, and responses to unconscious content, which leads to increased objectivity. In other words, there is the advantage of a more accurate personality assessment because subjective elements of the individual are less involved.	C
Among the validity scales of MMPI-2, which scale measures symptom validity in assessing atypical responses?	F	FBS	F(P)	TRIN	FBS stands for 'Fake Bad Scale' in MMPI-2, which is one of the scales measuring atypical responses. This scale assesses whether the respondent is answering inconsistently. Therefore, FBS does not mean symptom validity; it measures the consistency of the respondent's answers. TRIN stands for 'True Response Inconsistency', F(P) stands for 'Infrequency-Psychopathology', and F stands for 'Infrequency'.	The correct answer is 'FBS'. FBS is one of the atypical response scales in MMPI-2, which measures symptom validity. This scale compares the consistency of the respondent's answers with other scales in MMPI-2. In other words, if the respondent gives contradictory or inconsistent answers, the FBS score will increase. On the other hand, TRIN is a bipolar scale that measures whether the respondent answers inconsistently or tends to answer oppositely depending on the situation. F(P) is a false response scale that measures whether the respondent tends to exaggerate their condition or give pretentious answers. Finally, F is a general false response scale that measures whether the respondent tends to lie overall.	B
Which of the following is a characteristic symptom of paranoid personality disorder?	Emotional indifference	Delusions of grandeur	Emotional variability	Suspicion	One of the characteristic symptoms of paranoid personality disorder is 'suspicion,' which refers to a persistent mistrust or suspicion of others. This often occurs without any realistic basis and can interfere with interpersonal relationships and social functioning.	Among the characteristic symptoms of paranoid personality disorder, 'suspicion' is due to the tendency to doubt and distrust others. Such suspicion can occur without any realistic basis and may sometimes lead to delusions of grandeur. Additionally, these suspicions and possible delusions can cause emotional variability. However, this emotional variability is inconsistent, and at times, it can lead to a state of indifference.	D
Who was the scholar who first used the term 'clinical psychology' and also opened the first psychological clinic?	C. Rogers	W. Wundt	S. Freud	L. Witmer	L. Witmer is credited with using the term 'clinical psychology' for the first time and also for opening the first psychological clinic, thereby leading the concept and practical application of clinical psychology.	L. Witmer is considered the founder of clinical psychology, having established a psychological clinic in 1896. While the other options have had a significant impact on psychology, it was L. Witmer who established the psychological clinic.	D
Which of the following is least accurate about the description of exhibitionistic disorder in the DSM-5?	The sexual focus is on exposing one's genitals to an unsuspecting stranger.	Individuals may masturbate while imagining themselves exposing their genitals.	It usually occurs before the age of 18 and seems to lessen after the age of 40.	Individuals exhibiting this behavior typically attempt to engage in sexual activity with strangers.	The statement that individuals exhibiting exhibitionistic behavior typically attempt to engage in sexual activity with strangers is incorrect. The primary purpose of exhibitionism is sexual arousal from the act of exposure itself, and those exhibiting exhibitionistic behavior do not typically attempt to engage in sexual acts.	Exhibitionistic disorder in the DSM-5 is characterized by the primary goal of achieving sexual arousal through the act of exposing one's genitals to unsuspecting strangers. This behavior is usually repeated to satisfy one's own sexual desires, and it is not typically associated with attempts to engage in sexual activity with strangers. Therefore, the statement 'Individuals exhibiting this behavior typically attempt to engage in sexual activity with strangers' is not one of the characteristics of the disorder, making it the least accurate description.	D
Which of the following statements about sexual violence is correct?	Only women can be victims of sexual violence.	Sexual violence is a violation of sexual self-determination.	Rape can only be committed by strangers.	If one resists to the end, rape is impossible.	Sexual violence is a violation of sexual self-determination. This is the most appropriate statement because it involves coercion into sexual activity without consent, thus violating one's right to sexual self-determination. This is an issue that can be experienced by people of any gender.	The statement that 'Sexual violence is a violation of sexual self-determination' is correct because sexual violence infringes upon an individual's right to make decisions about their own sexual activities. Sexual self-determination means that an individual has the right to decide on their sexual behavior, and being forced into sexual activity by someone else violates this right. Sexual violence can affect individuals of any gender, and rape can occur even if the victim resists to the end. Additionally, victims of sexual violence can be men, women, children, the elderly, and can occur across all ages and genders. Therefore, sexual violence should be recognized as a violation of the human rights of all individuals. The statement that 'Rape can only be committed by strangers' is incorrect. Rape can occur regardless of the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim or the circumstances.	B
What function or ability is the Trail Making Test primarily designed to measure?	Visuospatial processing ability	Attention	Language ability	Memory	The Trail Making Test is designed to measure attention. This is because the process of drawing lines following numbers or alphabets requires attention. The test results can help identify attention deficits and assist in addressing them.	The Trail Making Test is designed to measure 'attention'. It involves a task where the test-taker must connect numbers and alphabets in sequence, which requires attention. Additionally, the test results can determine the level of attention through the time taken to complete the test or the number of errors made.	B
If a little child thinks there are more cookies just because their shape is different, which aspect of logical thinking according to Piaget's theory does this correspond to?	Issue with object permanence	Issue with hypothetical-deductive reasoning	Issue with the concept of conservation	Issue with egocentrism	This corresponds to an issue with the concept of conservation. This phenomenon refers to the difficulty young children have in understanding that the quantity, size, or form of a substance remains the same despite changes in its shape or appearance. In this case, the child does not recognize that the quantity of cookies is the same and mistakenly believes there are more cookies when their shape is different, which is an issue with the concept of conservation.	The child's logical thinking corresponds to an issue with the concept of conservation. The concept of conservation refers to the inability to understand that certain attributes or quantities remain unchanged despite apparent changes. The child, not recognizing the actual quantity of cookies, mistakenly believes that the quantity has increased when the shape changes, indicating a lack of understanding of the concept of conservation.	C
Which of the following is not a characteristic of standardized tests?	Maximizes the degree of freedom in responses.	All standardized tests have norms.	The procedure of administering the test is strictly controlled.	Creates and utilizes two or more equivalent forms.	Maximizing the degree of freedom in responses is actually a characteristic of standardized tests, as it allows the test-taker to freely express their responses, thereby enhancing the reliability of the test results.	The characteristic that is least associated with standardized tests is 'Maximizes the degree of freedom in responses.' This implies that the tools or procedures used in the test are designed to be as unrestricted as possible, allowing for free responses. This is intended to increase the reliability and validity of the test results by reflecting the test-taker's characteristics to the fullest and accommodating a variety of responses. The other options are all characteristics related to the standardization of tests.	A
Which part of the brain is suggested to be defective when considering the relationship between the brain and behavior in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?	Damage to the temporal lobe	Damage to the frontal lobe	Damage to the hippocampus	Damage to the limbic system	The frontal lobe is responsible for planning, reasoning, judgment, and abstract thinking. Patients with ADHD show defects in these functions, which suggests damage to the frontal lobe. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Damage to the frontal lobe'.	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with damage to the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is one of the important areas of the brain responsible for cognitive functions, emotional regulation, and planning. Patients with ADHD are known to exhibit symptoms such as attention deficit, hyperactivity, and impulsivity due to the impairment of this area's functions.	B
Which part of the brain is involved in visual processing and some aspects of visually mediated memory?	Temporal lobe	Occipital lobe	Frontal lobe	Parietal lobe	The primary visual cortex is a specific region of the brain that processes visual information, and it is located in the occipital lobe. The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain and is responsible for processing various sensory information, not only visual but also auditory, olfactory, and gustatory information. Therefore, the primary visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe.	The occipital lobe is the location in the brain that is involved in visual processing and some aspects of visually mediated memory. The occipital lobe processes visual information, and plays a role in storing and retrieving visually mediated memories. Therefore, the occipital lobe is one of the very important brain regions related to visual information processing.	B
The tendency to think that an attractive person will also have a good personality and leadership skills is called?	Attribution	Primacy effect	Halo effect	Principle of average	The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias where our preconceptions about attractive people lead us to assume they naturally have a good personality and leadership skills as well. This is because the positive impression of someone's appearance influences our judgment.	The correct answer is 'Halo effect.' The halo effect refers to the phenomenon where a positive impression of a person's appearance affects our evaluation of that person's character, abilities, etc. In other words, there is a tendency to naturally assume that an attractive person will have a good personality and leadership skills. This is one of the human cognitive biases, where the positive impression of someone's appearance automatically influences our evaluation of their other aspects.	C
A client comes to the psychological counseling room and is anxious because they do not know how they should behave (for example, what to say, what to do with their phone, how long the counseling session will last, etc.). What is the psychologist neglecting?	Interpretation	Structuring	Acceptance	Listening	The psychologist is neglecting structuring. Structuring involves setting the goals and direction of the counseling, organizing the content systematically, and guiding the client so that they do not feel anxious. Therefore, if structuring is not done properly, the client may feel anxious because they cannot grasp the situation.	The correct answer is 'Structuring'. In order for the psychologist to resolve the client's anxious situation, it is important to concretely understand the client's issues and present solutions accordingly. To do this, structuring and organizing the client's story is crucial. Therefore, if the psychologist neglects structuring, the client may not clearly understand what actions to take and may feel anxious.	B
Which of the following is NOT one of the four fundamental symptoms of schizophrenia, also known as the 4As, proposed by Bleuler?	Ambivalence	Autism	Alogia	Affective blunting	Alogia is indeed one of the four fundamental symptoms of schizophrenia proposed by Bleuler. However, it is characterized by a reduction in the frequency or amount of verbal expression, meaning that the patient speaks less or not at all, which is different from the other three fundamental symptoms.	While alogia is one of the four fundamental symptoms of schizophrenia proposed by Bleuler, the one that does not belong to the 4As is 'affective blunting.' Affective blunting refers to a dulling of emotions, making it difficult to express feelings. It is not considered one of the 4As because affective blunting can occur in mental disorders other than schizophrenia as well.	C
From a psychoanalytic perspective, what can be assumed to be the primary cause of fear of flying in a patient?	Experience of a plane accident that happened to a beloved parent in childhood	The uncontrollability of factors related to airplanes, such as crashes	Abnormalities in physiological activities such as the autonomic nervous system	The transference of unconscious conflicts that cause feelings of fear	From a psychoanalytic standpoint, the cause of the patient's fear can be found in the transference of unconscious conflicts. This means that the fear or anxiety the patient felt in different situations reemerges in situations related to flying. For example, the experience of a plane accident that happened to a beloved parent in childhood or anxiety felt in other situations may reappear in situations related to flying. This transference of unconscious conflicts is one of the important factors that cause the patient to have a fear of flying.	The transference of unconscious conflicts that cause feelings of fear refers to the phenomenon where emotions such as anxiety, fear, or stress that the patient felt in different situations are unconsciously transferred and associated with flying. For instance, if anxiety about airplanes developed due to a plane accident that happened to a beloved parent in childhood, this anxiety could be unconsciously transferred to other situations related to flying, causing fear. Understanding and treating this transference of unconscious conflicts plays a significant role in understanding and treating the patient's psychological state.	D
Which stage of Piaget's cognitive development stages is the development of object permanence first observed?	Sensorimotor stage	Concrete operational stage	Preoperational stage	Formal operational stage	The sensorimotor stage is the period from birth to 2 years of age, during which a child thinks that an object ceases to exist when it disappears. However, as object permanence develops during this stage, the child comes to understand that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen. Therefore, the sensorimotor stage is when object permanence first develops.	In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, the acquisition of the concept of object permanence first occurs during the sensorimotor stage. This period, from birth to 2 years of age, is when infants perceive the existence of their own bodies and surrounding objects through sensory stimuli and express this through movement, grasping the permanence of objects. Thus, this period is considered a very important time for the cognitive development of infants.	A
According to the DSM-IV, which of the following is NOT a subtype of schizophrenia?	Catatonic	Residual	Paranoid	Duplicate	Among the subtypes of schizophrenia, 'Duplicate' does not exist. Therefore, 'Duplicate' is the correct answer.	In the DSM-IV, the subtypes of schizophrenia include Residual, Catatonic, and Paranoid, but Duplicate is not included. Duplicate is not classified as a subtype of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV.	D
