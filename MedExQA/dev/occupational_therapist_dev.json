After the adolescent becomes proficient in this final step, the therapist would introduce the preceding step, such as shutting off the water, and continue to work in reverse order through the steps of the task. This technique is particularly beneficial for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder as it simplifies learning complex activities by dividing them into smaller, achievable segments. In backward chaining, an occupational therapist would start by teaching the final step of the activity first. In the context of washing hair, the last step is typically drying the hair with a towel. Once the adolescent has mastered this step, the therapist would then teach the step that comes before it, such as turning off the faucet, and so on, moving backward through the task sequence until the adolescent can perform the entire task from start to finish. This method is often used for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder to help them learn complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps.",

They are composed of lymphoid tissue that aggregates into small, spherical clusters embedded within the mucosal lining of the pharynx. Tonsils contribute to the immune defense by capturing and sifting through pathogens such as bacteria and viruses that enter the body via the oral and nasal passages. It is important to distinguish them from the spleen, which has a role in purifying the blood, and the thyroid gland, which secretes hormones for metabolic regulation. Unlike tonsils, lymph nodes, which are also part of the lymphatic system, are scattered throughout the body rather than being confined to the pharyngeal mucosal epithelium. The tonsils are part of the lymphatic system and are located in the throat area. They consist of lymphoid tissue that forms small, round clusters within the mucosal epithelium surrounding the pharynx. The tonsils play a role in the body's immune response by trapping and filtering out bacteria and viruses that enter through the mouth and nose. They are not to be confused with the spleen, which is an organ involved in filtering blood, or the thyroid gland, which produces hormones that regulate metabolism. Lymph nodes are also part of the lymphatic system but are distributed throughout the body and not specifically the structures forming masses in the mucosal epithelium of the pharynx.",

          "context": "Depolarization refers to a phase in the neuron's action potential when the electrical charge of the cell membrane shifts towards a less negative, or more positive, state. This shift occurs as a result of sodium ions (Na+) rushing into the cell once the voltage-gated sodium channels open. The entry of Na+ from the space outside the cell to the inside alters the membrane's potential, flipping it from a negative to a positive charge. This change is crucial for the transmission of electrical signals along the nerve cells. Depolarization is a stage in the action potential of neurons where the cell membrane's potential becomes less negative (more positive). This is primarily due to the influx of sodium ions (Na+) when voltage-gated sodium channels open. The movement of Na+ from the extracellular space into the cell changes the membrane potential from negative to positive, which is essential for the propagation of nerve impulses.",

Each ureter extends from one kidney, facilitating the downward flow of urine to the bladder via rhythmic contractions known as peristalsis. In contrast, the urethra is the channel through which urine is expelled from the bladder out of the body. While the prostate gland encircles the urethra in males and can influence urinary functions, it does not play a role in the transportation of urine from the kidneys. Additionally, the collecting ducts are part of the renal nephrons that gather urine before it is transferred to the ureters, but they are not the conduits that deliver urine to the bladder. The ureter is a pair of muscular tubes that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. Each kidney is connected to a ureter, which moves urine down to the bladder through peristaltic movements. The urethra, on the other hand, is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder.",
