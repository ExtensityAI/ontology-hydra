          "context": "The unit of radioactivity in the International System of Units (SI) is the Becquerel (Bq), named in honor of Henri Becquerel, who was a pioneer in the study of radioactivity. A single Becquerel corresponds to the radioactive decay of one atomic nucleus per second. Other units such as the Roentgen (R), Rad, and Curie (Ci) serve different purposes or are considered obsolete. Specifically, the Roentgen measures exposure to ionizing radiation, the Rad quantifies the absorbed dose of radiation, and the Curie, an older unit that predates the SI system, represents a much higher level of radioactivity compared to the Becquerel. The Becquerel (Bq) is the SI derived unit used to measure radioactivity. It is named after Henri Becquerel. One Bq is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second. The other units listed, Roentgen (R), Rad, and Curie (Ci), are either outdated or used for different measurements related to radioactivity. The Roentgen is a unit of exposure to ionizing radiation, the Rad is a unit of absorbed radiation dose, and the Curie is an older, non-SI unit of radioactivity that is much larger than the Becquerel.",

It quantifies the incidence of maternal deaths within a specified timeframe, scaled to 100,000 live births occurring within that same timeframe. Utilizing this ratio enables the tracking of advancements in maternal health and the efforts to diminish the occurrence of maternal fatalities, aligning with one of the objectives outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is important to distinguish the maternal mortality ratio from the maternal mortality rate, which measures the frequency of maternal deaths within a given population over a time period, independent of the number of live births. The maternal mortality ratio is a key health indicator that helps to assess the quality of healthcare systems, particularly in the context of maternal health. It is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. This ratio is used to monitor progress towards improving maternal health and reducing maternal deaths, which is one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The maternal mortality ratio is different from the maternal mortality rate, which is the number of maternal deaths in a population over a period of time, regardless of the number of live births.",

This reaction is not immediate but develops over a period of hours to days following antigen exposure. In contrast to type I hypersensitivity, which is antibody-mediated and occurs rapidly, DTH is characterized by the mobilization and activation of T cells and macrophages. This leads to an inflammatory response and potential tissue damage at the location where the antigen is present. A well-known example of this type of reaction is the tuberculin skin test for tuberculosis. In this test, a small quantity of tuberculin injected into the skin causes swelling and redness in individuals who have been previously sensitized to the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indicating a DTH response. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), or type IV hypersensitivity, is a form of immune response that is mediated by T cells and occurs several hours to days after exposure to an antigen. The tuberculin skin test, used to detect exposure to tuberculosis, is a classic example of a DTH reaction, where the injection of a small amount of tuberculin into the skin leads to a localized swelling and redness in individuals previously sensitized to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
