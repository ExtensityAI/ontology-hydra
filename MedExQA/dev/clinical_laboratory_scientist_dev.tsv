What is the unit of radioactivity that represents one disintegration per second of a radioactive atom?	Bq	Roentgen (R)	Rad	Ci	The unit of radioactivity in the International System of Units (SI) is the Becquerel (Bq), named in honor of Henri Becquerel, who was a pioneer in the study of radioactivity. A single Becquerel corresponds to the radioactive decay of one atomic nucleus per second. Other units such as the Roentgen (R), Rad, and Curie (Ci) serve different purposes or are considered obsolete. Specifically, the Roentgen measures exposure to ionizing radiation, the Rad quantifies the absorbed dose of radiation, and the Curie, an older unit that predates the SI system, represents a much higher level of radioactivity compared to the Becquerel.	The Becquerel (Bq) is the SI derived unit used to measure radioactivity. It is named after Henri Becquerel. One Bq is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second. The other units listed, Roentgen (R), Rad, and Curie (Ci), are either outdated or used for different measurements related to radioactivity. The Roentgen is a unit of exposure to ionizing radiation, the Rad is a unit of absorbed radiation dose, and the Curie is an older, non-SI unit of radioactivity that is much larger than the Becquerel.

What is the statistical indicator that represents the ratio of the number of deaths due to complications related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium to the number of live births in a specific year?	Maternal mortality rate	Perinatal mortality rate	Neonatal mortality rate	Maternal mortality ratio	The maternal mortality ratio serves as a crucial metric for evaluating the effectiveness of healthcare systems, with a particular focus on maternal care. It quantifies the incidence of maternal deaths within a specified timeframe, scaled to 100,000 live births occurring within that same timeframe. Utilizing this ratio enables the tracking of advancements in maternal health and the efforts to diminish the occurrence of maternal fatalities, aligning with one of the objectives outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is important to distinguish the maternal mortality ratio from the maternal mortality rate, which measures the frequency of maternal deaths within a given population over a time period, independent of the number of live births.	The maternal mortality ratio is a key health indicator that helps to assess the quality of healthcare systems, particularly in the context of maternal health. It is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. This ratio is used to monitor progress towards improving maternal health and reducing maternal deaths, which is one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The maternal mortality ratio is different from the maternal mortality rate, which is the number of maternal deaths in a population over a period of time, regardless of the number of live births.	D
Which lipoprotein contains the highest proportion of triglycerides?	LDL	VLDL	chylomicron	IDL	Chylomicrons, which are lipoprotein particles predominantly composed of triglycerides, are synthesized within the intestinal lining following the intake of dietary fats. Their primary function is to facilitate the transport of these dietary lipids from the intestines to various parts of the body. The substantial triglyceride composition of chylomicrons gives them a relatively low density when compared to other lipoproteins, which is the reason they have the highest percentage of triglycerides among the different types of lipoproteins.	Chylomicrons are lipoprotein particles that consist mainly of triglycerides. They are formed in the intestinal lining from dietary fats and are responsible for the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body. Chylomicrons have a lower density compared to other lipoproteins due to their high triglyceride content, which is why they contain the highest proportion of triglycerides among the lipoprotein options listed.

What is the delayed-type (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T cells?	erythroblastosis fetalis	myasthenia gravis	anaphylaxis	tuberculin reaction	Type IV hypersensitivity, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), is an immune reaction that is primarily driven by T cells. This reaction is not immediate but develops over a period of hours to days following antigen exposure. In contrast to type I hypersensitivity, which is antibody-mediated and occurs rapidly, DTH is characterized by the mobilization and activation of T cells and macrophages. This leads to an inflammatory response and potential tissue damage at the location where the antigen is present. A well-known example of this type of reaction is the tuberculin skin test for tuberculosis. In this test, a small quantity of tuberculin injected into the skin causes swelling and redness in individuals who have been previously sensitized to the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indicating a DTH response.	Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), or type IV hypersensitivity, is a form of immune response that is mediated by T cells and occurs several hours to days after exposure to an antigen. The tuberculin skin test, used to detect exposure to tuberculosis, is a classic example of a DTH reaction, where the injection of a small amount of tuberculin into the skin leads to a localized swelling and redness in individuals previously sensitized to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Which disease is related to the thyroxine (T4) test using radioactive isotopes?	Pancreatitis	Hepatitis	Hyperparathyroidism	Hyperthyroidism	The radioactive isotope-based thyroxine (T4) test is utilized to evaluate the activity of the thyroid gland by measuring the levels of T4 hormone it secretes. An overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is characterized by the excessive production of thyroid hormones such as T4. Thus, this test is especially pertinent for the diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism.	The thyroxine (T4) test using radioactive isotopes is a diagnostic tool used to assess thyroid function. Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and its levels can be indicative of thyroid health. Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive and produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, including T4.	D
