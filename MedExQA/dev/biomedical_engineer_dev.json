Therefore, the EEG waveform that is prominent in the parietal or occipital region and is suppressed by visual and sensory stimuli is the alpha wave. Alpha waves are brainwaves that are primarily present in a relaxed state and become more distinct during focused states such as closing the eyes or meditation. They have the characteristic of being suppressed by visual and sensory stimuli, and thus appear less when the eyes are open. Therefore, the EEG waveform that is prominent in the parietal or occipital region and is suppressed by visual and sensory stimuli is the alpha wave.",

This is one of the factors that can degrade the accuracy of measuring devices and requires calibration. Saturation refers to the condition where the measurement value reaches a maximum and does not increase further, dead zone refers to the condition where the measurement value does not change within a certain range, and breakdown refers to the destruction of the measuring device due to overload. Sensitivity drift is not a characteristic of nonlinearity in biometric measuring devices. Sensitivity drift means that the sensitivity of the biometric measuring device changes over time. This can occur due to environmental factors such as temperature or humidity. Therefore, the nonlinear characteristics of biometric measuring devices include saturation, dead zone, and breakdown. Saturation occurs when the output signal becomes fixed at a certain value once the input signal exceeds a certain range, dead zone occurs when the output signal does not change while the input signal is within a certain range, and breakdown occurs when the biometric measuring device fails if the input signal exceeds a certain threshold.",

This disrupts the normal contraction and relaxation of the heart, impairing its function and potentially leading to cardiac arrest. Therefore, fibrillation is one of the most dangerous conditions among heart diseases. The correct answer is 'Fibrillation'. Fibrillation is a phenomenon where the myocardium contracts and relaxes asynchronously due to the electrical and structural chaos in the heart.

The described phenomenon is actually thermoelectricity, which involves generating a voltage difference from a temperature difference and is used to measure temperature.
