    "domain": "Based on the questions in the file, the summary of occupational therapy topics includes a range of foundational knowledge from anatomy and physiology to neurological function, sensory integration, and public health principles. A strong emphasis is placed on the understanding of human body structures such as the semicircular ducts and ampullary crest, which are critical for balance and spatial orientation—important aspects in rehabilitation for individuals with vestibular or movement disorders. Neurological components such as the red nucleus and basal ganglia are highlighted for their roles in motor control, underscoring the neurological underpinnings of occupational performance. The importance of sensory modalities, including proprioception, pain, and temperature sensations, reflects the therapeutic emphasis on sensory processing and integration. In addition, questions related to vision and auditory pathways point to the relevance of sensory systems in occupational engagement. The file also touches on population health concepts such as prevention levels (primary, secondary, tertiary), showing the broader public health context in which occupational therapy operates, particularly in health promotion, disease prevention, and rehabilitation. Overall, the content aligns with the interdisciplinary knowledge base needed for effective occupational therapy practice, bridging biological sciences with therapeutic application. ￼",
