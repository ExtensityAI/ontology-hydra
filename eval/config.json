    "domain": "Biomedical engineering is a multidisciplinary field that integrates principles of engineering with biological and medical sciences to develop technologies that improve healthcare. A key area within the field is the design and regulation of medical devices, particularly with regard to patient safety. For instance, attachments on medical devices that are not intended to heat the patient must not exceed a surface temperature of 41°C. This threshold is established to prevent skin damage, thermal burns, and unintended increases in body temperature, ensuring a safe interaction between devices and the human body.\n\nAnother important aspect of biomedical engineering is the application of electromagnetic waves in diagnostic imaging. Technologies such as thermography, X-rays, microwaves, ultraviolet, and infrared imaging are used to visualize physiological parameters, detect abnormalities, and assist in clinical decision-making. These imaging modalities leverage different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, each suited for specific diagnostic purposes.\n\nUnderstanding human anatomy, especially organ structure, is also critical. For example, the heart wall is composed of three distinct layers—epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium—in that specific order. This anatomical knowledge is essential for the development of accurate diagnostic tools and interventions in cardiology.\n\nIn the realm of artificial organs, biomedical engineers must select materials that are both biocompatible and functionally effective. For instance, membrane oxygenators in heart-lung machines often use materials like silicone rubber or Teflon. These materials are chosen based on their permeability and ability to safely interact with blood and other tissues during procedures such as cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\nBiomedical signal processing is another core area, involving the interpretation of biological signals using techniques like modulation, demodulation, and amplification. These methods are critical for converting analog physiological data into meaningful diagnostic information, though not all concepts from general signal processing—such as synthesis—are applicable in the medical context.\n\nFinally, diagnostic devices such as bone densitometers highlight the precision of biomedical technologies. These devices, which use X-rays or ultrasound, are specialized tools designed to measure bone mineral density and assess conditions like osteoporosis. Their specificity contrasts with more general medical instruments like blood pressure monitors, underscoring the tailored nature of biomedical engineering solutions.\n\nOverall, biomedical engineering serves as a bridge between engineering innovation and medical application, focusing on developing safe, effective, and technologically advanced solutions to enhance patient care.",
