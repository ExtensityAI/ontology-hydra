## 1. Introduction to Biomedical Engineering
Biomedical engineering is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering principles with biological and medical sciences to advance healthcare technologies.

## 2. Key Topics within Biomedical Engineering

### 2.1 Medical Devices
- Design and regulation focusing on patient safety.
- Temperature thresholds for non-heating device attachments (e.g., maximum 41Â°C).

### 2.2 Diagnostic Imaging
- Utilization of electromagnetic waves in imaging techniques.
- Relevant imaging modalities: thermography, X-rays, microwaves, ultraviolet, and infrared imaging.
- Focus on resolution and safety, particularly in MRI systems.

### 2.3 Human Anatomy & Physiology
- Understanding organ structures for tool development, e.g., the layered structure of the heart wall.

### 2.4 Artificial Organs & Biocompatibility
- Material selection for artificial organs (e.g., silicone rubber, Teflon in membrane oxygenators).

### 2.5 Biomedical Signal Processing
- Techniques like modulation and demodulation for interpreting biological signals.

### 2.6 Specific Diagnostic Devices
- Devices like bone densitometers using X-rays or ultrasound for specific conditions.

## 3. Exclusions

### 3.1 Generalized Signal Processing
- Concepts such as synthesis not typically applied in biomedical contexts.

### 3.2 Non-Medical Engineering Disciplines
- Pure engineering disciplines without biological applications.

## 4. Gray Areas or Overlaps

### 4.1 Interdisciplinary Work
- Overlaps with health informatics related to data processing from diagnostic devices.
- User-interface and ergonomic concerns aligning with engineering design principles.

### 4.2 Regulatory & Policy Impact
- Intersection with healthcare policy on reimbursement and safety evaluations.

## 5. Vocabulary for Future Discussions
- Establishment of terms like 'biocompatibility', 'imaging modalities', and 'patient-centered solutions' to facilitate shared understanding.
