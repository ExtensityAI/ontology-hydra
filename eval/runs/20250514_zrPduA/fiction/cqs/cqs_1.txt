What are the precise definitions and scopes of key literary and narrative genres such as novel, novella, short stories, episodic narratives, and flash fiction, and how do they differ from one another?
How are emerging or hybrid genres (e.g., magical realism, postcolonial fantasy, regional fiction) classified within the ontology, and what criteria distinguish these from traditional categories?
What are the formal attributes and characteristics that define each genre and subgenre, including thematic focus, stylistic elements, and narrative techniques?
How should narrative forms like serialized fiction, web serials, and transmedia storytelling be modeled in terms of their serialization, platform, and episodic structures?
What are the core narrative elements (e.g., plot structures, character archetypes, world-building features) and their variations across different genres and formats?
How are narrative techniques such as point of view, narrative voice, and literary devices (symbolism, allegory, imagery) specified and differentiated?
What are the defining stylistic, thematic, and structural features of content such as social commentary, moral dilemmas, and cultural exploration within fiction works?
How should content and stylistic elements like characterization, tone, mood, dialogue, and setting be represented to accurately reflect the nuances of different works?
What are the attributes and classifications of fiction formats and mediums, including print editions, digital formats, audiobooks, serialized online formats, and metadata standards?
How are cultural annotations, regional tags, and linguistic identifiers structured to support regional, linguistic, and ethnoliterary diversity?
What criteria and properties determine audience categorizations such as children, young adults, adults, and culturally diverse groups?
How should reader engagement metrics (book clubs, reviews, social interactions) and accessibility options (format adaptations, multilingual editions, inclusive representation) be modeled?
What are the classifications and attributes related to publishing practices (traditional, independent, hybrid), rights management, licensing, and emerging publishing trends (digital distribution, self-publishing, social media marketing)?
How are societal, cultural, political, and regional contexts incorporated, including themes of social justice, identity, postcolonial narratives, and regional settings?
What are the technological considerations, such as digital rights management, metadata standards, digital asset management tools, and digital creation platforms, that influence the management of fiction content?
How should the scope and boundaries of graphic novels, comics, interactive fiction, and transmedia storytelling be defined within the ontology, including what overlaps are permissible or excluded?
In what ways can hybrid and multigenre works be characterized, especially those blending fiction with factual or documentary elements?
How are borderline cases such as fictionalized cultural or historical narratives, myth retellings, and experimental formats represented and classified?
What are the boundary considerations between fiction and adjacent domains like literary criticism, poetry, drama, and non-narrative media?
How should the ontology address the integration or exclusion of non-fiction works, poetry, plays, visual arts, and performing arts that relate to narrative fiction?
What criteria and classifications are used to model when multimedia adaptations or non-prose storytelling (e.g., films, theatre, video games) are considered part of or outside the scope of narrative fiction?
How are cultural, linguistic, and regional classifications modeled to reflect the diversity of linguistic backgrounds and regional publishing practices?
What formal properties distinguish different narrative forms and media in the ontology to ensure precise and consistent categorization?
How can the ontology support advanced querying and analysis of trends, such as emerging genres, stylistic innovations, or regional dominance in fiction publishing?
What mechanisms are necessary to incorporate evolving formats like augmented/virtual reality narratives or interactive fiction into the existing classification system without ambiguity?
