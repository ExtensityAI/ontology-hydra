What are the precise definitions and distinguishing features of the core literary and narrative genres (e.g., novel, novella, short stories, episodic narratives) within fiction books?
How are genre subcategories (e.g., mystery, science fiction, fantasy, horror, historical fiction) formally classified and differentiated?
What are the key narrative forms (e.g., linear, non-linear, episodic) and techniques (e.g., point of view, narrative voice, stylistic devices) that characterize fiction works?
How should blended and interdisciplinary forms such as graphic novels, interactive fiction, transmedia storytelling, and virtual reality narratives be modeled in relation to traditional fiction genres?
What are the defining attributes of thematic classifications (e.g., social justice, cultural conflict, gender, existential dilemmas) as applied to fiction works?
How are narrative elements like plot devices, character archetypes, setting, and world-building systematically represented and related?
What are the standard literary stylistic devices (e.g., symbolism, allegory, imagery, diction) used in fiction, and how are they characterized?
How can different narrative perspectives (first-person, third-person, omniscient) and narrative tones be precisely modeled?
What are the formal attributes, such as format types (print, digital, audio) and classifications (metadata, genre tags, thematic labels), that should be included for each fiction work?
How should the ontology capture diverse audiences (children, young adults, adults from various cultural backgrounds) and considerations of accessibility (multilingual editions, inclusive representation)?
What relationships exist between different publishing practices (traditional, independent, hybrid) and rights management, licensing, and marketing trends?
How are emerging digital trends like self-publishing, social media marketing, and digital distribution represented within the management and classification of fiction books?
What are the key elements of cultural, political, and societal contexts (e.g., regional settings, ethnoliterary diversity, postcolonial themes) incorporated within the ontology?
How do technological and digital considerations (e.g., DRM, digital asset management, metadata standards) influence the organization and representation of fiction books?
What are the boundary conditions for including or excluding certain media, such as poetry, plays, visual arts, and non-narrative media, within the scope of fiction books?
How should borderline cases like graphic novels, hybrid genre works, and experimental narratives be categorized and modeled?
What are the formal relationships and distinctions between fiction works and adjacent domains like literary criticism, scholarly theory, and educational materials?
How can the ontology represent the interrelations between formats (print, digital, audio), and their impact on content and user engagement?
In what ways can cultural and regional narratives—such as folklore, indigenous stories, or myth adaptations—be integrated into the classification and contextualization of fiction books?
How should the system handle complex or hybrid works that blend factual, historical, or documentary elements with fictional storytelling?
What constraints or rules are necessary to ensure consistent classification and avoid scope overlaps or ambiguities within the domain?
