What are the specific attributes and properties of different formats and mediums—such as print editions, digital formats, audio formats, serialized and web-based formats—and how should these be represented?
How should accessibility considerations (e.g., multilingual editions, inclusive representation, format adaptations) be incorporated into the ontology to support diverse audiences?
What classification criteria and attributes are essential for capturing audience demographics, engagement activities, and social interactions related to fiction (e.g., book clubs, online reviews)?
How should market and publishing practices—such as traditional, independent, or hybrid publishing, as well as rights management and emerging digital distribution trends—be modeled?
What are the thematic, cultural, and societal contexts that influence fiction works, including regional settings, ethnoliterary diversity, postcolonial themes, and social justice issues?

How should borderline cases—like graphic novels, interactive and experimental narratives, hybrid genres, and folklore adaptations—be represented and classified?
To what extent should the ontology distinguish between fiction and adjacent domains such as literary criticism, scholarly theory, children's/YA fiction, and reference works?
How are overlapping media formats (e.g., comics vs. graphic novels), and hybrid or multigenre works best represented to respect their multifaceted nature?
What rules or properties define the boundary between fictionalized cultural/historical narratives and factual or ethnographic content?
How can the ontology accommodate highly experimental or nontraditional narrative structures that challenge conventional definitions of fiction?
What classification schemas are most effective to differentiate between narrative-driven fiction and media dominated by non-prose storytelling forms?
