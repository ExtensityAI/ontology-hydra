What are the precise definitions of "novel," "novella," "short story," "episodic narrative," "flash fiction," and "serialized fiction," and how do they differ based on length, structure, or publication format?
How are genres such as science fiction, fantasy, mystery, and horror distinguished from each other within the ontology, especially for works that blend genres or subgenres?
What classifications or taxonomies are used to categorize hybrid or interdisciplinary forms like magical realism, postcolonial fantasy, and experimental narratives?
How should thematic classifications like social justice, cultural conflicts, identity, and ethical dilemmas be represented and related to specific works or genres?
What are the key narrative elements and techniques (e.g., plot structure, character archetypes, world-building, narrative voice) that need detailed representation, and how are variations characterized?
How are literary devices such as symbolism, allegory, imagery, and stylistic styles modeled in terms of their role within a work’s narrative and aesthetic?
How should different formats (print, digital, audio, serialized, web-based) and associated metadata (title, author, publisher, language, regional tags, genre tags) be structured for precise retrieval?
What are the distinctions between audience groups (children, young adults, adults) in terms of content, thematic complexity, and presentation, and how should inclusivity and multicultural aspects be incorporated?
How can accessibility features such as multilingual editions, format adaptations, and inclusive representation be codified in the ontology?
How are indigenous narratives, folklore-based fiction, and regional storytelling traditions represented, especially in relation to culturally specific classifications?
What are the key publishing practices (traditional, independent, hybrid), licensing models, and emerging distribution channels that should be represented?
How are recognition, awards, and market trends incorporated as metadata or contextual attributes within the ontology?
How should the influence of cultural, political, and societal contexts—such as postcolonial themes and identity discourse—be modeled to reflect their impact on fiction works?
What digital and technological considerations, including DRM, metadata standards, digital rights management, and metadata interoperability, are critical for accurate representation?
How do we define and handle boundary cases such as graphic novels, interactive fiction, transmedia narratives, and hybrid works that blur traditional classifications?
In what ways can the ontology distinguish between works that are purely fictional and those that may incorporate factual or documentary elements, especially in historical or folklore adaptations?
How should visual and performing arts (films, theater, dance scripts) that are narrative-driven but primarily non-prose be represented or linked within the ontology?
What criteria determine the inclusion of works that are experimental, nonlinear, or metafictional, and how are these formats modeled computationally?
How do we address the overlap and boundary with adjacent domains like literary criticism, ethnographic collections, and educational materials, and what denotations clarify their separation or connection?
What classifications are needed for metadata standards, digital distribution platforms, and rights management tools to support semantic interoperability?
How should the ontology account for the diversity of regional and ethnoliterary narratives, including indigenous stories, regional dialects, and cultural annotations?
What rules or constraints should be applied to explicitly exclude non-fiction, poetry, drama, and non-narrative media, ensuring clear scope boundaries?
