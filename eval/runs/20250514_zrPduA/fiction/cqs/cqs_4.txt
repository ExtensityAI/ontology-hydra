What are the core definitions and distinctions between different narrative literary forms such as novels, novellas, short stories, episodic narratives, flash fiction, and serialized fiction?
How should genres and subgenres of fiction (e.g., romance, mystery, science fiction, fantasy, horror, historical fiction, YA, children's fiction) be categorically defined and differentiated within the ontology?
What thematic classifications (e.g., identity, social justice, migration, cultural conflicts, gender, psychological topics) are relevant, and how are they hierarchically structured and related to genres?
How are blended and interdisciplinary narrative forms such as graphic novels, interactive fiction, transmedia storytelling, and augmented/virtual reality narratives represented and distinguished from traditional forms?
What are the essential narrative elements (plot structures, character types, settings, narrative points of view) that should be explicitly modelled?
How should stylistic literary devices (such as symbolism, allegory, imagery, diction) and narrative techniques (tone, mood, perspective, experimental structures) be categorized and linked to specific works or genres?
What are the critical attributes and properties for describing content elements like plot devices, characterization, stylistic features, dialogues, tone, and world-building?
Which formats and mediums (print editions, e-books, audiobooks, serialized online formats, social media storytelling) are necessary to include, and how do their metadata and classification differ?
How should bibliographic metadata (title, author, publisher, publication date, ISBN, language, regional tags) and thematic labels (genre, cultural annotations) be represented to support discovery and classification?
In terms of audience and social context, what attributes define different reader groups (children, YA, adults, diverse cultural backgrounds), and how are community interactions (book clubs, reviews, online discussions) modelled?
What accessibility features (format adaptations, multilingual editions, inclusive representations) need to be incorporated into the ontology?
How are regional narratives, indigenous stories, folklore-based fiction, and ethnoliterary diversity characterized and differentiated?
What classifications or attributes are essential for representing publishing practices (traditional, independent, hybrid), rights management, licensing, and emerging trends such as self-publishing and social media marketing?
How should the influence of cultural, political, and societal contexts—such as themes addressing social justice, identity, postcolonial narratives—influence the classification and representation of fiction works?
What digital and technological aspects (distribution platforms, DRM, metadata standards, digital asset management and creation tools) are critical for describing modern digital fiction publishing?
How are relevant boundary cases handled, such as graphic novels, comics, interactive media, and hybrid works that blur traditional genre and format distinctions?
What criteria and definitions should be used to distinguish fiction books from non-fiction works, poetry, dramatic texts, and visual/performing arts within the ontology?
How can the ontology effectively represent the overlaps and boundaries with adjacent domains such as literary criticism, children’s literature, educational materials, and ethnographic storytelling?
