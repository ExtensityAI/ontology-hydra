What are the precise definitions and distinctions between the various narrative literary forms, such as novel, novella, short stories, episodic narratives, flash fiction, and serialized fiction?
How should genre classifications (e.g., romance, mystery, science fiction, fantasy, horror, historical fiction, YA, children’s fiction) be hierarchically structured and what criteria differentiate subgenres?
What are the key thematic categories (e.g., social justice, cultural conflicts, identity, moral dilemmas) and how are they formally represented within the ontology?
How should blended or interdisciplinary forms like graphic novels, interactive fiction, transmedia storytelling, and AR/VR narratives be classified and related to traditional narrative forms?
What are the essential narrative elements and techniques (plot structure, character development, setting, point of view, literary devices) that should be modeled, and how are they interconnected?
How are stylistic devices—such as diction, symbolism, allegory, imagery—and narrative devices—tone, mood, perspective—defined and distinguished in the ontology?
What are the standard formats and mediums (print, digital, audio, serialized/web-based) used for fiction books, and what metadata and classification schemes (such as genre tags and regional identifiers) are essential for their description?
How should we model audience segmentation (children, YA, adults, multicultural audiences), reader engagement practices, and accessibility features like format adaptations and multilingual editions?
What are the permissible and enforceable rights management and licensing aspects (copyright, DRM, licensing agreements), and how can they be represented within the ontology to account for legal constraints?
How should digital distribution platforms, digital rights management systems, and metadata standards for digital assets be modeled to reflect the digital transformation of fiction publishing?
What criteria define the boundaries of the domain, especially regarding the exclusion of non-fiction works, poetry, drama, visual arts, and non-narrative media?
How can we formalize boundary cases such as graphic novels, interactive and experimental media, hybrid works, and culturally/reconstructed historical narratives that blur traditional classifications?
What relationships and classifications are necessary to distinguish folklore, ethnoliterary narratives, and myth-based fiction from other literary genres?
How should the ontology handle the relation between works and their variations, adaptations, editions, and translations across media and languages?
In what ways can we capture the cultural, political, and societal contexts influencing fiction works, including regional, ethnoliterary, and thematic influences?
How should metadata related to literary awards, market trends, readership analytics, and recognition be integrated to support industry and scholarly analyses?
What are the interoperability requirements with other domains, such as literary criticism, digital humanities, and legal frameworks, to ensure comprehensive coverage of fiction book-related data?
