1. Domain Overview
1.1 Scope and Definition
- The ontology covers Fiction Books, defined as narrative works—primarily prose—created from imagination rather than strictly factual or reference content.
- Fiction books include 
  - Novels, novellas, short stories, anthologies
  - Illustrated, graphic, and interactive/digital-first formats, provided the narrative fiction is central
  - Serialized fiction, experimental and non-linear forms
- Works may originate in any language, including original and translated/bilingual/multilingual editions, and may be in print or digital form.
- The domain explicitly excludes:
  - Non-fiction (biographies, memoirs, essays, history, textbooks, academic monographs, reference materials)
  - Purely visual (comics, graphic novels not closely aligned with prose), oral, or audio storytelling without written narrative forms
  - Poetry and dramatic works unless presented as narrative prose fiction
  - Fanfiction and unpublished derivatives unless officially published
  - Marketing, sales analytics, and merchandising unrelated to classification/discovery
  - Video games and non-literary transmedia experiences

1.2 Purpose and Boundaries
- The ontology serves the classification, discovery, management, and access of fiction books across physical and digital platforms.
- It supports multilingual, multicultural, and inclusive representations and classifies works regardless of publication pathway (traditional, digital-first, self-published, hybrid).
- Out-of-scope materials are strictly defined (see Section 10).
