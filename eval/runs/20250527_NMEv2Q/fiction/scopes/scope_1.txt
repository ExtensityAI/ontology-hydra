1. Domain Definition
1.1 Included Topics
- Representation of fiction books focusing on core narrative elements.
- Character entities including traits, roles, relationships, and development arcs.
- Events capturing plot points, conflicts, resolutions, and sequence.
- Settings encompassing locations, time periods, environments, and world-building details.
- Story arcs addressing linear and non-linear narrative progressions, including hybrid and interactive story structures.

1.2 Excluded Topics
- Non-fiction literature and factual texts.
- Author biographies and publishing metadata unrelated to narrative content.
- Media formats beyond the scope of fiction books unless directly related to adaptation of narratives.
- Detailed linguistic analysis such as stylistics or discourse analysis outside narrative structure.

1.3 Gray Areas and Overlaps
- Adaptations and transmedia narratives which intersect with film, video games, and interactive media; inclusion focuses on source fiction book narrative representation.
- Interactive fiction and new media storytelling—overlaps with technological and multimedia domains; scope emphasizes narrative elements rather than user interaction mechanisms.
- Cross-cultural narrative structures and folklore influences; overlaps with cultural studies and anthropology, focusing here on their impact on story arcs and character development.

2. Boundary Clarifications
2.1 Narrative Elements Scope
- Detailed modeling of characters, events, settings, and story arcs as primary units.
- Consideration of multimedia and interactive storytelling only as they relate to narrative content in fiction books.

2.2 Technological Framework
- Ontology designed for semantic web compatibility and interdisciplinary analysis.
- Emphasis on interoperability and user requirements for literary and narrative research contexts.

3. Terminology and Vocabulary
- Character: includes protagonist, antagonist, supporting roles, and hybrid/complex identities.
