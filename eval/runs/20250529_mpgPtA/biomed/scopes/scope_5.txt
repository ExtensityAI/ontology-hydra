1. Introduction to Biomedical Engineering
   - Definition: Biomedical engineering is a multidisciplinary field that integrates principles of engineering with biological and medical sciences to develop technologies that improve healthcare.
   - Focus: The development of safe, effective, and technologically advanced solutions to enhance patient care.

2. Medical Devices
   2.1. Design and Regulation
       - Emphasis on ensuring device safety and regulatory compliance.
       - Key threshold for external device temperature: Surface temperature must not exceed 41Â°C to prevent skin damage and other issues.
   2.2. Exclusion
       - Concepts from general signal processing like synthesis that are not applicable in the medical context.

3. Diagnostic Imaging
   3.1. Use of Electromagnetic Waves
       - Utilization of imaging modalities such as thermography, X-rays, microwaves, ultraviolet, and infrared imaging.
       - Each modality operates on specific bands of the electromagnetic spectrum for diagnostic purposes.
   3.2. Gray Areas
       - Overlap with adjacent domains such as radiology and imaging technology.

4. Understanding Human Anatomy
   4.1. Specific Focus
