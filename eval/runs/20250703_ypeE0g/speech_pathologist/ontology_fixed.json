  "name": "Speech pathology, as illustrated by the questions in the dataset, encompasses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of a broad range of communication and swallowing disorders. The field addresses conditions affecting speech fluency, such as stuttering—including its subtypes like neurogenic and psychogenic stuttering—emphasizing the factors that influence severity, anticipation, and therapeutic assessment using tools like the Stuttering Severity Instrument. Voice disorders are another critical area, with assessments like CAPE-V and the Voice Handicap Index used to evaluate pitch, loudness, quality, and the emotional or functional impact of voice problems. Treatment techniques such as the accent method and voice hygiene practices (e.g., maintaining proper humidity or using high pillows for reflux patients) are key strategies. Disorders like vocal nodules and spasmodic dysphonia are evaluated through both perceptual and acoustic measures (e.g., cepstral peak prominence and mean airflow rate). Speech pathology also addresses language disorders through standardized and dynamic assessments, including tools like the Language Scale for School-Aged Children and approaches based on Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development. The importance of tailoring scripts and intervention complexity to children’s cognitive capacities is emphasized in therapy. Neurological conditions such as aphasia and traumatic brain injury are differentiated by their cognitive and linguistic profiles, including deficits in grammar, pragmatics, or prosody. The discipline also explores the anatomical and physiological underpinnings of communication, such as the role of Broca’s area in speech programming and the mechanics of the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory in phonation. Swallowing disorders are examined through phases like the pharyngeal stage, highlighting movements like hyoid and larynx elevation. Additionally, auditory training, particularly the difficulty of open-set tasks, and rehabilitative strategies post-laryngectomy (e.g., tracheoesophageal speech), round out the scope of speech pathology, underscoring its integrative approach to supporting communication and swallowing functions across diverse populations.",
