1. Domain Definition
   - Speech pathology is the field concerned with the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of a broad range of communication and swallowing disorders.
   - It encompasses conditions affecting speech fluency, voice, language, and swallowing functions.

2. Core Topics
   2.1 Speech Disorders
      - Stuttering
        - Neurogenic stuttering
        - Psychogenic stuttering
      - Assessment tools: Stuttering Severity Instrument
      - Factors: Severity, anticipation
   2.2 Voice Disorders
      - Assessment tools: CAPE-V, Voice Handicap Index
      - Evaluation parameters: Pitch, loudness, quality
      - Conditions: Vocal nodules, spasmodic dysphonia
        - Perceptual and acoustic measures: Cepstral peak prominence, mean airflow rate
      - Treatment techniques: Accent method, voice hygiene practices
      - Emotional and functional impact
   2.3 Language Disorders
      - Assessment: Standardized and dynamic assessments
      - Tools: Language Scale for School-Aged Children
      - Approaches based on cognitive theories like Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development
      - Importance of script and intervention complexity
   2.4 Neurological Conditions
      - Disorders: Aphasia, traumatic brain injury
      - Profiles: Cognitive and linguistic
      - Deficits: Grammar, pragmatics, prosody
   2.5 Anatomical and Physiological Foundations
      - Role of Broca’s area in speech programming
      - Myoelastic-aerodynamic theory of phonation
   2.6 Swallowing Disorders
      - Phases: Pharyngeal stage
      - Movements: Hyoid and larynx elevation
   2.7 Auditory Training and Rehabilitation
      - Open-set tasks difficulty
      - Post-laryngectomy strategies: Tracheoesophageal speech

3. Terminology
   3.1 Speech and Language Terms
      - Stuttering: A speech disorder characterized by disruptions in the flow of speech
      - Voice disorders: Conditions affecting pitch, loudness, and quality of voice
   3.2 Assessment and Measurement Tools
      - CAPE-V: An assessment tool for voice quality
      - Stuttering Severity Instrument: A tool for evaluating the severity of stuttering
   3.3 Neurological Concepts
      - Aphasia: A language disorder caused by brain damage that affects communication
      - Broca’s area: A region in the frontal lobe associated with speech production
   3.4 Swallowing and Auditory Terms
      - Pharyngeal stage: A phase of swallowing involving the movement of food from the mouth to the esophagus
      - Tracheoesophageal speech: A method of speech used post-laryngectomy where air is redirected from the trachea into the esophagus to produce sound

   - Hierarchical Relationships
     - Stuttering and its subtypes (neurogenic, psychogenic)
     - Voice disorders and associated assessments and treatments
     - Language disorders' relationship with cognitive capacities and developmental theories
     - The relationship between physiological mechanisms and speech/language functions
