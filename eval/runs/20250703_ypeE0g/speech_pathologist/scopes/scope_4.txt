1. Domain Definition:
   - Speech pathology encompasses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of communication and swallowing disorders.
   - It addresses conditions affecting speech fluency, voice disorders, language disorders, neurological conditions, and swallowing disorders.

2. Core Topics:
   2.1. Speech Fluency
       - Stuttering
         - Neurogenic stuttering
         - Psychogenic stuttering
       - Severity factors
       - Anticipation and therapeutic assessment
       - Stuttering Severity Instrument
       - Speech fluency in multilingual children
   2.2. Voice Disorders
       - Voice assessments
         - CAPE-V
         - Voice Handicap Index
       - Treatment techniques
         - Accent method
         - Voice hygiene practices
       - Disorders
         - Vocal nodules
         - Spasmodic dysphonia
       - Acoustic measures
         - Cepstral peak prominence
         - Mean airflow rate
   2.3. Language Disorders
       - Standardized and dynamic assessments
         - Language Scale for School-Aged Children
       - Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development
       - Tailored scripts and intervention complexity
   2.4. Neurological Conditions
       - Aphasia
       - Traumatic brain injury
       - Cognitive and linguistic profiles
       - Deficits in grammar, pragmatics, or prosody
   2.5. Anatomical and Physiological Underpinnings
       - Broca’s area in speech programming
       - Myoelastic-aerodynamic theory in phonation
   2.6. Swallowing Disorders
       - Pharyngeal stage
       - Hyoid and larynx elevation
   2.7. Auditory Training
       - Open-set tasks
       - Rehabilitative strategies post-laryngectomy
         - Tracheoesophageal speech

3. Terminology:
   - Stuttering: A speech disorder characterized by repetition, prolongation, or blockage of sounds, words, or phrases.
   - CAPE-V: Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice, a tool used for assessing voice quality.
   - Voice Handicap Index: A questionnaire to determine the emotional and functional impacts of voice disorders.
   - Broca’s Area: A region in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere involved in speech production.
   - Myoelastic-aerodynamic theory: A theory explaining the vibration of vocal folds in sound production.
   - Tracheoesophageal speech: A method of speaking when air is directed through a surgically-created valve into the esophagus.
   - Hierarchical relationships in key concepts:
       - Language disorders include subtypes such as aphasia, which further relates to specific cognitive and linguistic deficits. 
       - Under voice disorders, assessment tools and treatment strategies themselves constitute a hierarchical structure, categorically branching into specifics like the accent method under voice hygiene practices.
