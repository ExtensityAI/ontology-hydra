3. Terminology
   3.1. Domain-Specific Terms
       - Stuttering: A speech disorder characterized by repeated or prolonged sounds, syllables, or words.
       - Voice Disorders: Conditions affecting pitch, loudness, and quality of the voice.
       - Language Disorders: Impairments in understanding and/or using spoken, written, or other symbol systems.
       - Swallowing Disorders: Dysfunctions in the swallowing process.
       - Broca’s Area: A region in the frontal lobe associated with speech production.
       - Myoelastic-Aerodynamic Theory: A theory explaining the vibration of vocal folds in sound production.
       - Tracheoesophageal Speech: A method of speech used post-laryngectomy where air is redirected into the esophagus.
