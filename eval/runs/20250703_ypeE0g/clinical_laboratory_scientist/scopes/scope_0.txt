3. Terminology
   3.1. Clinical Laboratory Science
        - Definition: A field involving various laboratory disciplines meant to provide diagnostic, therapeutic, and predictive information for patient care.
   3.2. Graft Types
        - Isograft: A transplant between genetically identical individuals
        - Xenograft: A transplant between individuals of different species
   3.3. Cytopathology
        - Cytocentrifugation: A technique used to concentrate cells in fluids with low cellularity
   3.4. Hematopoiesis
        - Hematopoietic organs: Tissues responsible for the production of all blood cell types
   3.5. Flow Cytometry
        - Definition: A technology used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of particles in a fluid
   3.6. Hierarchical Relationships in Hematology
        - Blood cells derive from hematopoietic stem cells
        - Granulocyte maturation is a multistage process
   3.7. Quality Control Terminology
        - Terminology such as "control samples" and "calibration" are foundational in ensuring laboratory accuracy.
