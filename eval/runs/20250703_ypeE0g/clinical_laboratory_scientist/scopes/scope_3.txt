3. Terminology
   3.1. Transplant Immunology
       - Graft: A piece of living tissue that is transplanted surgically.
         - Isograft: Tissue transplanted between genetically identical individuals.
         - Xenograft: Tissue transplanted between different species.
   3.2. Microbiology
       - Pathogen: An organism that causes disease.
         - Characteristics, diagnostics, and susceptibility profiles.
   3.3. Cytopathology
       - Cytological examination: The study of cells to diagnose diseases.
       - Histological examination: The study of tissues in a detailed manner.
   3.4. Quality Control
       - Compliance: Adherence to laboratory standards and regulations.
   3.5. Instrumentation
       - Photomultiplier tube: A device used to detect and amplify light signals, important in diagnostic instruments such as flow cytometers.
   3.6. Neurophysiology
       - Brain wave: Patterns of electrical activity produced by the brain, indicative of different physiological and pathological states.
