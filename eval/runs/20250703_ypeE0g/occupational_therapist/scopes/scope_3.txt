1. Domain Definition
   - Occupational therapy encompasses the therapeutic use of everyday activities to enhance participation and performance in daily life for individuals with physical, sensory, or cognitive impairments. This domain integrates knowledge from anatomy, physiology, neuroscience, sensory integration, and public health to enable rehabilitation and health promotion.
   - Core conceptual areas in this domain include anatomical and physiological foundations, neurological mechanisms, sensory integration and processing, rehabilitation techniques, and public health principles in occupational therapy.

2. Core Topics
   2.1 Anatomical and Physiological Foundations
       - Human body structures involved in balance and spatial orientation
       - Semicircular ducts and ampullary crest
       - Musculoskeletal system
   2.2 Neurological Mechanisms
       - Neural control of motor functions
       - Red nucleus and basal ganglia
       - Neural pathways related to balance disorders
   2.3 Sensory Integration and Processing
       - Sensory modalities: proprioception, pain, and temperature
       - Vision and auditory pathways
       - Sensory integration therapies
   2.4 Rehabilitation Techniques
       - Interventions for vestibular disorders
       - Use of diagnostic tools and technology in therapy
       - Culturally competent therapeutic interventions
   2.5 Public Health Principles
       - Health promotion and disease prevention
       - Levels of prevention: primary, secondary, tertiary
       - Integration of occupational therapy in public health initiatives

3. Terminology
   3.1 Domain-Specific Terms and Concepts
       - Vestibular disorders: Conditions affecting balance and spatial orientation
       - Sensory integration: Process by which the brain organizes sensations for use
       - Occupational performance: Ability to carry out activities of daily life
       - Non-communicable diseases: Chronic diseases typically requiring long-term treatment
   3.2 Hierarchical Relationships
       - Anatomical structures -> Neurological components -> Sensory modalities
       - Rehabilitation techniques -> Occupational performance improvements
       - Public health principles -> Community health interventions
