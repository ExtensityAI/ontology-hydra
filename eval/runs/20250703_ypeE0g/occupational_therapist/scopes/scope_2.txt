3. Terminology

3.1 Key Terms and Concepts
   - Proprioception: The sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement.
   - Sensory Integration: The process by which we receive information through our senses, organize this information, and use it to participate in everyday activities.
   - Vestibular Rehabilitation: Therapy intended to alleviate primary and secondary problems caused by vestibular disorders.
