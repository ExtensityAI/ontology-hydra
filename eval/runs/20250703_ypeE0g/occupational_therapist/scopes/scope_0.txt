1. Domain Definition
   - Occupational therapy focuses on enabling individuals of all ages to engage in meaningful activities of daily life through therapeutic interventions that address physical, sensory, or cognitive challenges. This domain encompasses an interdisciplinary approach that integrates knowledge from anatomy, neuroscience, public health, and therapy practices to enhance occupational performance and promote health.
2. Core Topics
   2.1 Human Anatomy and Physiology
      - Semicircular ducts and ampullary crest
      - Musculoskeletal structures
   2.2 Neurological Function
      - Red nucleus and basal ganglia
      - Motor control systems
   2.3 Sensory Integration
      - Sensory modalities: proprioception, pain, temperature
      - Visual and auditory pathways
   2.4 Public Health Principles
      - Levels of prevention (primary, secondary, tertiary)
      - Population health and disease prevention
   2.5 Rehabilitation Strategies
      - Movement therapies
      - Virtual reality-based rehabilitation
   2.6 Pediatric Occupational Therapy
      - Developmental disorders
      - Collaborative approaches with families and educators
3. Terminology
   3.1 Vestibular System
      - Semicircular ducts: Fluid-filled tubes in the inner ear crucial for balance
      - Ampullary crest: Sensory organ within the semicircular ducts that detects head movements
   3.2 Neurological Structures
      - Red nucleus: Midbrain structure involved in motor coordination
      - Basal ganglia: Group of nuclei involved in movement regulation and control
   3.3 Sensory Processing
      - Proprioception: Sense of body position and movement
      - Sensory integration: The process by which the brain organizes sensory information for use in daily life
   3.4 Public Health Hierarchy
      - Primary prevention: Strategies to prevent disease before it occurs
      - Secondary prevention: Interventions to halt or slow the progress of disease
      - Tertiary prevention: Managing disease post-diagnosis to slow or halt disease progression
   3.5 Rehabilitation Technologies
      - Virtual reality-based rehabilitation: Therapeutic applications of VR to enhance physical and cognitive rehabilitation
