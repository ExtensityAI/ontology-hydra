## 2. Exclusion of Topics
- Political issues outside of Antarctic governance (e.g., domestic affairs of treaty-signatory countries)
- Comprehensive anthropological studies unrelated to ecological impacts
- Exploration of non-Antarctic polar regions (e.g., the Arctic)
- Some historical exploration narratives lacking relevance to current ecological and scientific discussions

## 3. Gray Areas and Overlaps
- **Research Collaboration**: Potential overlap with other regions in terms of international research collaborations, particularly those involving climate change.
- **Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems**: While the focus is on marine habitats, there is an overlap with terrestrial ecosystems and their responses to glacial meltwater.
- **Travel Safety Protocols**: Risks associated with tourism may intersect with broader discussions of environmental safety and emergency management in non-Antarctic locations.
- **Youth Involvement**: Initiatives aimed at increasing youth involvement in STEM can have implications beyond the Antarctic context, particularly in global conservation efforts.

## 4. Conclusion
This document serves as a foundational guideline for discussions and research concerning the Antarctic domain, highlighting critical areas of focus as defined by our team's collective expertise. Future conversations should adhere to this scope to maintain clarity and relevance.
