# Scope Document: Domain of Antarctica

## 1. Inclusion Criteria

### 1.1. Geographic and Scientific Features
- Glacial and ice sheet dynamics
- Cryosphere interactions and processes
- Oceanic and atmospheric systems specific to Antarctica
- Geological formations, including mountains, valleys, and subglacial features
- Ecosystems and biodiversity unique to the Antarctic region
- Climate patterns and variations over time

### 1.2. Research Areas
- Climate change impacts on Antarctic ice and ecosystems
- Glacial retreat and its implications for global sea level rise
- Satellite remote sensing applications for monitoring Antarctic changes
- Ice core sampling techniques and their significance for paleoclimate research

### 1.3. Environmental and Societal Aspects
- Environmental advocacy efforts and policies related to Antarctica
- Conservation strategies and their implementation in the Antarctic region
- The role of international agreements, such as the Antarctic Treaty System

### 1.4. Technological Applications
- Advanced data analysis techniques relevant to ice and climate research
- GIS technology applications in mapping and visualizing ice melt patterns
- Innovations in field research equipment and methodologies for Antarctic studies

## 2. Exclusion Criteria

### 2.1. Geographic Limitations
- Non-Antarctic regions and their ecosystems
- Studies focusing on the Arctic region, unless comparative analyses are made

### 2.2. Irrelevant Scientific Disciplines
- Non-cryospheric geology unrelated to Antarctica
- Marine biology studies outside of the Antarctic context
- Atmospheric studies that do not specifically pertain to Antarctic weather systems

### 2.3. Societal Factors
- Political discourse unrelated to Antarctic governance
- Socioeconomic analyses not linked to Antarctic research or conservation efforts

## 3. Gray Areas and Overlaps with Adjacent Domains

### 3.1. Climate Change Research
- Overlap with global climate change discussions regarding impacts and adaptations
- Studies in other polar regions that may share methodologies or principles but differ significantly in context

### 3.2. Marine Studies
- Potential overlaps with oceanography in the Southern Ocean, focusing on currents and marine speciesâ€™ interactions with Antarctic conditions

### 3.3. Environmental Policy
- Intersection with global environmental policies and treaties that affect international governance, potentially extending to more extensive discussions than just Antarctica

This scope document serves to identify key topics and boundaries within the domain of Antarctica for collaborative discourse and focused research.
