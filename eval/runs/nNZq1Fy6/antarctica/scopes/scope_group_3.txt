# Scope Document: Key Topics and Boundaries within the Domain of Antarctica

## 1. Inclusion Criteria for the Antarctica Domain
This section defines the key topics and areas that are explicitly included within the domain of Antarctica, leveraging the collective expertise of the team.

### 1.1 Marine Ecosystems
- Study of Antarctic marine biodiversity
- Impact of climate change on marine life
- Use of technologies for underwater imaging and monitoring 
- Research involving underwater drones

### 1.2 Glaciology
- Dynamics of Antarctic ice sheets 
- Historical changes in ice cover over the past century
- Influence of glacial melting on sea-level rise
- Remote sensing technologies for tracking ice movement

### 1.3 Climate Change 
- Effects of climate systems on polar regions
- Analysis of climate modeling related to Antarctic weather patterns
- Impacts of climate change on local and global ecosystems
- Socio-economic ramifications of climate change connected to polar research

### 1.4 Environmental Policy
- Policy implications on climate action specific to vulnerable communities
- Global equity in climate response and governance
- Advocacy for sustainable practices in relation to Antarctica
- Role of international agreements and collaborations on climate policies

### 1.5 Outreach and Education
- Engaging public awareness about Antarctic issues
- Programs focused on the importance of Antarctic research 
- Workshops and outreach conducted for diverse communities
- Use of technology/digital tools to facilitate education

## 2. Exclusion Criteria for the Antarctica Domain
This section delineates topics that fall outside the scope of the Antarctica domain.

### 2.1 Non-Antarctic Regions
- Research related to the Arctic and non-polar regions
- Studies focusing on tropical or temperate climates

### 2.2 General Climate Change Not Specific to Polar Regions
- Broad climate phenomena without direct ties to Antarctic data
- Areas of climate science that do not involve polar dynamics or ecosystems

### 2.3 Non-Environmental Policies
- Issues unrelated to climate or environmental policy, such as economic policy unrelated to climate change
- Political controversies not directly tied to Antarctic governance or conservation

### 2.4 Behavior of Species Non-Native to Antarctica
- Studies that focus solely on non-Antarctic species
- Introduction of invasive species without context to their impact on Antarctica

## 3. Gray Areas and Overlaps with Adjacent Domains
This section identifies potential overlaps or gray areas that require careful consideration.

### 3.1 Global Climate Change versus Local Impacts
- The interaction between global climate trends and regional impacts on Antarctica.
  
### 3.2 Biodiversity and Conservation Efforts
- Efforts to conserve biodiversity may intersect with policy advocacy and climate action, causing potential overlaps.

### 3.3 Socio-Economic Factors and Environmental Change
- The interplay between local community impacts from global decisions surrounding climate action and Antarctic research outcomes.

### 3.4 Technology Impacts 
- Use of technology in environmental monitoring may overlap with both research and policy domains, blurring the lines of application.

By clearly defining these scopes, this document serves as a touchstone for discussions and initiatives focused on Antarctic research and policy, ensuring that all team members share a common understanding and language.
