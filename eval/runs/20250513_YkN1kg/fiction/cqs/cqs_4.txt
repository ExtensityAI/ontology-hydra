How should key concepts such as "genre," "subgenre," and "hybrid genre" be precisely defined and distinguished within the ontology to reflect their nuances and overlaps?
What are the essential attributes and properties that uniquely characterize each literary genre and subgenre, including characteristics like tone, stylistic features, and thematic elements?
How can the ontology effectively classify narrative structures (e.g., linear, nonlinear, episodic) and literary elements such as themes, motifs, and stylistic devices in a way that supports content analysis and searchability?
What are the definitive attributes and relationships that differentiate between various formats and media, including traditional print, digital, audio, and multimedia content?
How should digital and interactive formats like hypertext fiction, visual novels, and multimedia e-books be modeled in terms of their narrative components and user engagement features?
What metadata fields are critical for describing and categorizing fiction books, including bibliographic identifiers, thematic keywords, language, literary awards, and stylistic tags?
How can semantic features such as sentiment, character analysis, and plot arcs be represented via NLP techniques within the ontology to support content analysis and recommendation systems?
What rules and constraints should govern classification and tagging to accommodate genre-blending, experimental formats, and transmedia storytelling without ambiguity?
How should the ontology handle the inclusion of crossover or gray-area content such as graphic novels, comics, and digitally mixed media, ensuring consistent classification?
What formal definitions and properties are necessary to model the relationships between original fiction works and adaptations (such as film or game adaptations), especially regarding their content and narrative connection?
How can the ontology encapsulate publication models, distribution channels, licensing, and accessibility features while clearly delineating these from core content descriptions?
What attributes are essential for representing the audience demographics (e.g., age groups, reader communities) and measuring reception, such as reviews and critical acclaim, within the content paradigm?
How should emerging trends like digital storytelling innovations, diversity, and transmedia narratives be incorporated into the ontology to reflect current developments?
What are the boundaries and distinctions between fiction content and related but excluded domains like non-fiction, poetry, plays, and visual media, and how should these exclusions be formally represented?
How can the ontology model the overlaps and grey areas, especially in cases like folk tales, oral narratives transcribed into written form, and content that blends fiction with non-fiction elements?
What mechanisms can be employed to represent digital and interactive fiction that blurs traditional boundaries, such as hypertext, augmented reality storytelling, and alternate reality games?
How should the ontology accommodate cultural and historical narratives that straddle folklore and fiction, including transcribed oral traditions and reconstructed narratives?
In what ways can the model represent the relationships and contextual overlaps with related domains like film adaptations, gaming narratives, and multimedia projects, while maintaining clear boundaries?
How can the scope be structured to focus on content attributes—narrative, thematic, stylistic, and genre classifications—while explicitly excluding production, marketing, and legal logistics?
What formal constraints are required to ensure the clarity and consistency of classifications, especially in complex cases of genre blending and innovative formats?
How can the ontology facilitate advanced content searches, filtering, and analysis based on stylistic features, themes, formats, and audience demographics to support researchers, publishers, and readers?
What definitions and models are necessary to encode narrative and thematic richness in a way that is accessible for digital analysis, curation, and educational use?
