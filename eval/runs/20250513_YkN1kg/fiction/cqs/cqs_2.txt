What are the precise definitions and hierarchical classifications of the main literary genres and subgenres within fiction, and how are these classifications distinguished from each other?
How are narrative structures (e.g., linear, nonlinear, episodic) formally characterized in an ontology, and what attributes differentiate them?
What are the standardized metadata elements (such as title, author, publication date, publisher) used to describe fiction works, and how can they be structured for interoperability?
How can thematic keywords, motifs, and stylistic features (e.g., tone, diction, literary devices) be effectively represented and linked to specific fiction works?
What are the key properties and semantic features (e.g., sentiment, character relationships, thematic elements) that NLP-based content analysis tools employ to analyze fiction content?
How should digital formats (ePub, MOBI, PDF), audio media (audiobooks), and multimedia formats (visual novels, hypertext fiction) be modeled in relation to the textual content?
How can formats and media types be categorized and related to respective narrative content, especially in hybrid and interactive digital fiction?
What are the essential attributes and classifications used to represent and differentiate traditional print publications (hardcover, paperback) from digital and audio formats?
How can we model the relationships among derivative and adapted works (e.g., film, TV series, video games) and their originating fiction texts within an ontology?
What are the types of publishing models, distribution channels, and licensing rights that influence the accessibility and dissemination of fiction content, and how can these be represented?
How can we encode and relate narrative elements such as character archetypes, settings, themes, and motifs across different works and genres?
What linguistic and stylistic features (narrative voice, tone, diction) are critical for classifying and analyzing fiction works, and how can they be systematically modeled?
How should authorship, publication history, and awards be represented, especially considering multi-author collaborations, pseudonyms, and recognition?
What metadata and classification strategies are effective for supporting advanced search, recommendation, and personalization (e.g., genre tags, thematic keywords, sentiment analysis)?
How can digital preservation standards and accessibility features be integrated into an ontology to support long-term digital archiving of fiction content?
How should reader demographics, community engagement, reviews, and ratings be modeled to capture audience reception and trends?
What are the boundaries, definitions, and distinctions between fiction and non-fiction, and how should borderline cases such as folk tales or mythic narratives be represented?
How are digital storytelling innovations (interactive fiction, hypertext, transmedia narratives) conceptualized and linked within the domain model?
How can the ontology account for cultural and linguistic diversity, including multilingual texts, folk narratives, and oral traditions transcribed into written form?
What are the explicit rules and constraints that differentiate content classification (e.g., fiction vs. non-fiction) and handle gray areas or overlaps (e.g., hybrid formats, adaptations)?
