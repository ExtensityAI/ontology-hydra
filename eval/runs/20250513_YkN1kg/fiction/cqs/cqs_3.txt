What are the precise definitions and distinctions between the main literary genres (e.g., Science Fiction vs. Fantasy vs. Literary Fiction) and their typical narrative characteristics?
How are subgenres such as cyberpunk, steampunk, and magical realism formally classified and differentiated within the broader genre categories?
What are the key narrative structures (linear, nonlinear, episodic) and stylistic features (diction, tone, narrative voice) that characterize different genres and subgenres of fiction?
How can an ontology represent various narrative techniques such as framing devices, epistolary forms, or experimental methods, and their relevance to genre classification?
What are the essential attributes of a fiction book's metadata (title, author, publication date, publisher, language) that influence cataloging, retrieval, and content analysis?
How should genre tags, thematic keywords, and other descriptive metadata be modeled to support accurate content categorization and searchability?
In digital formats, what are the relevant attributes of media such as ePub, MOBI, PDF, and multimedia elements (maps, illustrations), and how do they relate to narrative content?
What properties differentiate traditional print formats (hardcover, paperback) from digital and audio formats (audiobooks, narrated works) in terms of their technical and content features?
How can an ontology capture and represent transmedia storytelling and cross-platform narratives that span books, games, and web content?
What metadata and content analysis techniques (e.g., NLP-based thematic analysis, sentiment analysis) are relevant for structural and semantic content characterization of fiction works?
How should the ontology model the relationships among publication models (traditional, self-published, hybrid), licensing, ownership rights, and digital preservation standards?
What demographic and socioeconomic attributes (e.g., age groups, readership communities, fandoms) are relevant for understanding audience reception and how should they be represented?
How can trends, emerging themes, and social issues within contemporary fiction be systematically incorporated into the model?
What distinctions and modeling considerations are necessary for classifying graphic novels, comics, and visual storytelling as narrative fiction?
How should hybrid and experimental formats that blend fiction with non-fiction, or utilize digital and multimedia elements, be represented within the ontology?
What criteria determine when a work is considered a work of fiction versus folklore, oral tradition, or recontextualized narrative, especially regarding cultural and heritage content?
How are interactive and hypertext fiction, visual novels, and alternate reality games characterized, and what are their defining narrative and technical properties?
What are the important boundaries and clarifications needed to differentiate core content (narrative, themes, stylistic features) from publication logistics, industry practices, and legal considerations?
How should overlaps between primary literary content and related media (film adaptations, series, web platforms) be represented to maintain clarity in the ontology?
