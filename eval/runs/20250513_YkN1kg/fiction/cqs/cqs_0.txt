What are the precise definitions and distinctions between the main fiction genres such as Literary Fiction, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, Mystery, Romance, Historical Fiction, and their respective subgenres?
How are hybrid genres and genre-blending categories (e.g., science fantasy, historical romance) formally characterized within the ontology?
What are the key narrative structures (e.g., linear, nonlinear, episodic, fragmented) used in fiction, and how can these be classified systematically?
Which literary elements (e.g., themes, motifs, stylistic devices like metaphor, symbolism, irony) are essential to characterize and differentiate fiction works?
How can narrative techniques such as epistolary forms, framing devices, and experimental storytelling be modeled and distinguished within the ontology?
What attributes define characters in fiction, including archetypes, psychological profiles, and relational dynamics?
How can setting and worldbuilding elements (locations, cultural backgrounds, environmental context) be represented as metadata and content features?
What are the typical formats (print, digital, audio, multimedia) of fiction books, and how should these be organized and related?
How should digital content formats (ePub, MOBI, online serialization) and interactive media (visual novels, hypertext fiction, multimedia e-books) be represented and linked to their textual content?
What metadata standards (title, author, publication date, publisher, language, awards) are critical for cataloging fiction, and how can thematic keywords, sentiment, or plot summaries be incorporated?
How can the genre, subgenre, and thematic tags be standardized to support content classification and retrieval?
Which aspects of publishing models (traditional, self-publishing, hybrid), distribution channels, rights management, and digital preservation are relevant to include in a content-focused ontology?
How can audience demographics (children, young adult, adult), reader communities (fandoms), and critical reception (reviews, ratings) be modeled?
What emerging trends such as digital storytelling, transmedia narratives, and cultural diversity practices should be included as dynamic or evolving aspects of the domain?
How should the ontology handle gray areas where content overlaps (e.g., graphic novels as narrative fiction, hybrid formats, adaptations into films or games)?
In what way can folk tales, oral traditions transcribed into written form, and other cultural narrative content be integrated within the domain of fiction, considering their relevance and classification?
How can the boundaries between fiction content and related media forms (films, comics, games) be clarified and represented when content roles intersect?
What are the constraints and formal rules to distinguish fiction from non-fiction (biographies, essays, historical artifacts) within the ontology?
How should the ontology represent metadata related to supplementary digital content such as maps, illustrations, or interactive features integrated with fiction works?
What modeling approaches can effectively capture the distinctions and overlaps among digital, multimedia, and traditional textual fiction formats?
How can adaptations (e.g., film, TV series, web-based versions) be linked to original fiction works, while maintaining clarity on their external or related status?
What classification schemes are most suitable for representing complex narratives that involve transmedia storytelling and cross-platform content distribution?
How can stylistic and linguistic features such as narrative voice, tone, diction, or stylistic devices be systematically recorded or modeled?
What are the possible methods to encode narrative analysis (e.g., plot arcs, thematic categorization) for computational content analysis or semantic analysis?
How should the ontology treat excluded topics—such as non-fictional works, poetry, plays, and visual media—to maintain clarity of scope?
How can cultural and literary heritage, including folk tales and oral traditions, be integrated without misclassification as mere fiction content?
In modeling digital and interactive fiction, what structures are needed to represent hypertext, visual novels, and AR/VR narrative elements that blur traditional distinctions?
How should the ontology accommodate the dynamic nature of genre and format overlaps, including experimental or hybrid content?
What rules or guidelines are necessary to distinguish and model boundary conditions, ensuring clarity between core fiction content and related but out-of-scope media or industry logistics?
