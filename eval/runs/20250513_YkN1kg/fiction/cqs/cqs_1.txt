What are the precise definitions and distinguishing features of the main literary genres and subgenres (e.g., fantasy, science fiction, horror, mystery, romance, etc.) within the domain of fiction books?
How can narrative structures such as linear, nonlinear, episodic, and fragmented be formally characterized and represented in an ontology?
What are the key literary elements (e.g., themes, motifs, stylistic devices) that should be included, and how are they related to narrative techniques and genre classifications?
How should character development, including types of archetypes and psychological profiles, be modeled to capture character relationships and evolution?
What attributes and metadata (e.g., title, author, publication date, language, awards) are essential for describing fiction books and their content?
How can complex themes such as identity, resilience, and cultural heritage be semantically encoded, and how do they relate to genre, narrative, and stylistic features?
What distinctions need to be made between different formats and media (print, digital, audio, multimedia, interactive formats), and how should these be represented in an ontology?
How can multimedia and digital content (maps, illustrations, interactive elements) associated with fiction books be modeled and linked to textual content?
What models or frameworks are suitable for representing genre tags, thematic keywords, and descriptive metadata to facilitate content analysis and classification?
How should transmedia storytelling, adaptations, and hybrid formats (e.g., content blending fiction and documentary elements) be captured within the ontology?
What are the relevant constraints or rules for defining relationships between genres, subgenres, formats, and narrative techniques?
How can metadata about publishing models, distribution channels, licensing, and digital preservation be integrated without conflating content descriptions?
How should reader reception data (reviews, ratings, community engagement) and market segmentation be represented to support analysis of audience and reception?
What distinctions are necessary between fiction and non-fiction, and how might borderline cases (e.g., folk tales, oral traditions) be efficiently modeled?
How should emerging forms such as hypertext fiction, visual novels, and transmedia narratives that blur traditional boundaries be represented within the ontology?
Which elements of cultural and literary heritage (e.g., folk tales, oral narratives) are pertinent as narrative content, and how should they be related to modern fiction?
How can the ontology accommodate evolving trends like diversity, representation, and innovative digital storytelling techniques while maintaining clarity and consistency?
What metadata or content features are critical to differentiate between primary narrative content and scholarly or critical analysis, and how should they be modeled?
