# Scope Document: People, Life Events, Social Relationships, and Contextual Information

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the key topics and boundaries within the domain of People, Life Events, Social Relationships, and Contextual Information. Our aim is to establish a framework for future discussions and collaborative research initiatives among experts in psychology, anthropology, coaching, and sociology.

## 2. Inclusions
The following topics and themes fall within this domain:

### 2.1 People
- Individual identities and personal narratives
- Social roles and community belonging
- Cultural identity and expressions
- Influence of technology on self-perception

### 2.2 Life Events
- Personal milestones (e.g., marriage, childbirth, and career changes)
- Traumatic events and their psychological effects
- Migration experiences and adaptation
- Chronic illness and disability adjustments

### 2.3 Social Relationships
- Family dynamics and support systems
- Peer relationships and social networks
- Community structures and engagement
- The role of social media in shaping relationships
 
### 2.4 Contextual Information
- Environmental factors affecting individual lives (e.g., urban vs. rural settings)
- Historical and cultural contexts influencing social relationships
- Economic conditions and their impact on life events
- Technological advancements in communication and community formation

## 3. Exclusions
The following topics and themes are explicitly excluded from this domain:

### 3.1 Non-Human Factors
- Non-social entities and relationships (e.g., relationships with pets)
- Environmental phenomena unrelated to human activities or emotions

### 3.2 Purely Economic Analysis
- Economic theories or financial models without tie-ins to social implications

### 3.3 Individual Psychological Disorders
- Clinical diagnoses and treatment-specific methodologies outside the realm of community context (e.g., isolated treatment of PTSD without considering community impact)

### 3.4 Purely Academic Theories
- Theories or frameworks that do not incorporate real-world applications or societal implications

## 4. Gray Areas and Overlaps
The following themes present gray areas or overlaps with adjacent domains:

### 4.1 Technology and Social Interaction
- While we include the impact of technology on social relationships, the domain does not cover the technical specifications or designs of digital tools themselves.

### 4.2 Health and Well-being
- Discussions surrounding mental health are included, but the medical aspects or specific treatment protocols are excluded, leaning instead towards societal effects of health-related events.

### 4.3 Cultural Norms and Values
- Cultural dynamics affecting life events and relationships are included, but discussions on cultural theory divorced from life experiences are excluded.

## 5. Conclusion
This scope document serves as a foundational framework for understanding the complex interplay between people, life events, social relationships, and the context in which they exist. By clarifying inclusions, exclusions, and gray areas, we aim to enhance collaborative discourse and research outcomes.
